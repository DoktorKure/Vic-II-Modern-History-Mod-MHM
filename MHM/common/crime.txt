#Special note: crime icons are useless - the game ignores them and assigns the graphical icons in gfx/interface/crime_strip.dds based on order entry in this file. First entry is icon = 1, second entry is icon = 2, etc.
#active = yes means this crime gets assigned randomly by the game. Scripted crimes that are manually assigned or removed like this crime rework features should NEVER have active = yes in the entry
#There is no way to remove crime as remove_crime does not work, so a no_crime crime has to be added to remove a crime.
