The British decided to name the city after the Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab, Sir James Broadwood Lyall. The name was coined by combining the surname of the Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab, Lyall, with "Pur" which is derived from old Sanskrit language meaning "city". In the late 1970s, the Government of Pakistan changed the name of the city from Lyallpur to "Faisalabad" (meaning City of Faisal), in honor of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, who made several financial contributions to Pakistan.
