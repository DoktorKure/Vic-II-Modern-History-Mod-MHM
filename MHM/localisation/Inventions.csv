space_station_invention;Space Station;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
space_station_invention_desc;A space station, also known as an orbital station or an orbital space station, is a spacecraft capable of supporting a human crew in orbit for an extended period of time that lacks major propulsion or landing systems. Stations must have docking ports to allow other spacecraft to dock to transfer crew and supplies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
space_docking;Orbital Docking;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
space_docking_desc;A space rendezvous is a set of orbital maneuvers during which two spacecraft, one of which is often a space station, arrive at the same orbit and approach to a very close distance. Rendezvous requires a precise match of the orbital velocities and position vectors of the two spacecraft, allowing them to remain at a constant distance through orbital station-keeping. Rendezvous may or may not be followed by docking or berthing, procedures which bring the spacecraft into physical contact and create a link between them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
spacewalk;Space Suit;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
spacewalk_desc;A space suit is a garment worn to keep a human alive in the harsh environment of outer space, vacuum and temperature extremes. Space suits are often worn inside spacecraft as a safety precaution in case of loss of cabin pressure, and are necessary for extravehicular activity (EVA), work done outside spacecraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
man_in_orbit;Human Spaceflight Technology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
man_in_orbit_desc;Human spaceflight is spaceflight with a crew or passengers aboard a spacecraft.

Thus chemical energy stored in coal is converted successively into thermal energy, mechanical energy and, finally, electrical energy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
gas_power_plant;Gas-fired Power Station;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
gas_power_plant_desc;A gas-fired power plant is a type of fossil fuel power station in which chemical energy stored in natural gas, which is mainly methane, is converted successively into: thermal energy, mechanical energy and, finally, electrical energy.

natural_gas_processing_desc;Natural gas, is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
oil_power_plant;Oil Power Plant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
oil_power_plant_desc;Heavy fuel oil was once a significant source of energy for electric power generation. After oil price increases of the 1970s, oil was displaced by coal and later natural gas. Distillate oil is still important as the fuel source for diesel engine power plants used especially in isolated communities not interconnected to a grid. Liquid fuels may also be used by gas turbine power plants, especially for peaking or emergency service. Of the three fossil fuel sources, oil has the advantages of easier transportation and handling than solid coal, and easier on-site storage than natural gas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
coal_liquifaction;Coal Liquefaction;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
coal_liquifaction_desc;Coal liquefaction originally was developed at the beginning of the 20th century. Although it was generally much more expensive to produce oil from coal than from natural petroleum, the political as well as economic importance of achieving as much independence as possible in this sphere was sufficient to overcome any objections. CTL also received new interest in the early 2000s as a possible mitigation option for reducing oil dependence, at a time when rising oil prices and concerns over peak oil made planners rethink existing supply chains for liquid fuels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

participatory_economy_desc;Sometimes referred to as Parecon, Participatory economics is a economic model in which allocation of resources and production of goods is centered around either full or partial input from those effected by it, weighted to their impact from it.

peer_to_peer_economy_desc;The advent of the internet facilitates the creation of new methods of organizing production, on of which is the peer-to-peer economy which brings with it a new economic model, Commons-based peer production – commonly abbreviated as CBPP. Under this model of economic organization the normal property and ownership relationships of market-based systems either do not exist or exist in very loose non-rigid forms. This creates a unique system in regards to the means of production that many point to as a possible alternative to more traditional market economies altogether.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Already this new 'Small Rocket Lift Device' has found application for use in reconnaissance, amphibious assaults, naval boarding, and to generally increase the maneuverability and adaptability of infantry ground forces.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Likewise, the production structure began to change on the sector level. Instead of a single firm manning the assembly line from raw materials to finished product, the production process became fragmented as individual firms specialized on their areas of expertise;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

new_inflation_theory;New Inflation Theory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
new_inflation_theory_desc;Today, most economists favor a low and steady rate of inflation. Low (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation reduces the severity of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn, and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilising the economy. The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to monetary authorities. Generally, these monetary authorities are the central banks that control monetary policy through the setting of interest rates, through open market operations, and through the setting of banking reserve requirements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
