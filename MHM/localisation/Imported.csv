It was easy to see where wildfires had ripped across the high plains weeks earlier, because those fields were still black. And now there was nothing left to feed the cattle.'\n\nIt's been a long time since most of our homeland saw any rain.

dissolve_the_upper_house_desc;Supreme executive power in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state emanates from $CAPITAL$, through the figure of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch. The absolute monarch is the final authority in all matters of the state, but the bureaucracy and the military are the pillars that sustain the absolutist government. In addition, the landed aristocracy, which often acts as the bureaucracy, expects and receives positions of power in the government, positions appointed by the monarch. This is necessary for the normal function of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state - the aristocrats are the governor generals, the privy-councillors, the high-ranking bureaucrats, the ministers, the judges and the executors of the monarch's decisions. For these functions, several government institutions exist and are populated by the landed nobility - the Committee of Ministers of $COUNTRY$, the Governing Senate, the State Council. They help draft and apply laws, manage foreign and internal policy, plan wars and administer the military, advise the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch as well as judge and administer justice. The monarch still can and has the final say in all these matters, and is his royal prerogative to do away the currently appointed aristocrats and pick new ones. By taking this step - effectively dissolving the upper house and appointing new ministers - the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch can surround himself with sycophants and petty nobility that are willing to do whatever he wants them to do - for a time, at least. This break in the unspoken agreement between the monarch and the bureaucrats, the monarch and the aristocracy, will bring consequences - besides exposing internal fractures in the government to the international community, it is sure to anger the nobles and sow confusion throughout the government ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The news sent shockwaves through the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nobility - used to the occasional replacements, but not to such an earthshattering and drastic extent. Dissatisfaction is rampant, with many speculating (behind closed doors) that the monarch is setting up minor nobles, mostly sycophants and toadies, to execute the whims of the crown.

If one of these ingredients are missing, the structures become useless and the military corps are powerless to stop decay from setting in.

EVTDESC1620;The Hawai'i Sugar Strike of 1946, which became one of the most expensive strikes, was organized after a period of martial law on the island of Hawai'i to protest unfair working conditions imposed by the plantations on the island. The strike would prove successful, at least temporarily, and would help further drive social change on the island as the colonial government was further weakened by increased organization and resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1621;The 'Hawai'i Democratic Revolution' was the name of a series of non-violent protests, strikes, and marches carried out by a newly unified regional Democratic Party of Hawai'i alongside several left-wing groups such as the regional branch of the Community Party. The aim of the uprisings was the decades of abuse on the island by corrupt government and poor working conditions by the many plantations on the island, as well as poverty. The events historically culminated in statehood for Hawai'i and the ouster of white minority rule as the Republican party dominance on the island was dealt its final blow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1622;John A. Burns, though not a native of Hawai'i, became a prominent figure in the Democratic Party of Hawai'i after becoming involved in the Democratic Revolution. Formerly a police officer he would eventually rise through local leadership positions in the Democratic Party of Hawai'i, eventually becoming its chair as he worked to build a broad coalition both within the party's progressive elements and with other organizations such as the ILWU and the Communist Party of Hawai'i. Later in life he would go on to serve as the new state's second governor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1623;With Republican leadership both on and off the island and the business elite increasingly fearing the communist elements of the Democratic Revolution, there have been calls by the territorial legislature for an investigation from the House Un-American Activities Committee. Historically, this resulted in the arrest of seven influencial members of the movement who were tried under the Smith Act and held until 1958.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1624;The waning influence of the more moderate and centre-right factions of the Democratic Party of Hawai'i saw the party as a whole move left-ward, with Burns rising its ranks and attempting to re-envision the party as a centre-left party, working to curtail communist influence and instead draw people towards his progressive agenda. By 1954 the right-wing faction of the DPH had collapsed, paving the way for a DPH victory in the 1954 elections - seeing the total number of seats finally won by a DPH majority. Even with this majority though, the appointment of a Republican governor - Samuel King - to the island by then President Eisenhower would see their agenda frustrated, with a use of over 71 vetoes over the course of his appointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
