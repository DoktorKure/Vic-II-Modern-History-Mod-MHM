Likewise, the production structure began to change on the sector level. Instead of a single firm manning the assembly line from raw materials to finished product, the production process became fragmented as individual firms specialized on their areas of expertise;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

new_inflation_theory;New Inflation Theory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
new_inflation_theory_desc;Today, most economists favor a low and steady rate of inflation. Low (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation reduces the severity of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn, and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilising the economy. The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to monetary authorities. Generally, these monetary authorities are the central banks that control monetary policy through the setting of interest rates, through open market operations, and through the setting of banking reserve requirements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
