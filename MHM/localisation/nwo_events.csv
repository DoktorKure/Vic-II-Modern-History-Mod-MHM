EVTDESC8018201;Sallal ordered that the military academy in San'a go on full alert — opening all armories and issuing weapons to all junior officers and troops. On the evening of September 25, Sallal gathered known leaders of the Yemeni nationalist movement and other officers who had sympathized or participated in the military protests of 1955. Each officer and cell would be given orders and would commence as soon as the shelling of al-Badr's palace began. Key areas that would be secured included Al-Bashaer palace (al-Badr's palace), Al-Wusul palace (Reception area for dignitaries), the radio station, the telephone exchange, Qasr al-Silaah (The Main Armory), and the central security headquarters (Intelligence and Internal Security). The battle at the palace continued until guards surrendered to the revolutionaries the following morning. The radio station was first to fall, secured after a loyalist officer was killed and resistance collapsed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC80182011;On the royalist side, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Israel supplied military aid, and Britain gave covert support, while the republicans were supported by Egypt and were supplied warplanes from the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were involved. Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 Egyptian troops and weapons. Despite several military actions and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate by the mid-1960s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC8018202;Saudi Arabia, fearing Nasserist encroachment, moved troops along its border with Yemen, as the King Hussein of Jordan dispatched his Army chief of staff for discussions with al-Badr's uncle, Prince Hassan. Between October 2–8 four Saudi cargo planes left Saudi Arabia loaded with arms and military material for Yemeni royalist tribesmen however, the pilots defected to Aswan. Ambassadors from Bonn, London, Washington D.C. and Amman supported the Imam while ambassadors from Cairo, Rome and Belgrade declared support for the republican revolution. The USSR was the first nation to recognise the new republic, and Nikita Khrushchev cabled Sallal: "Any act of aggression against Yemen will be considered an act of aggression against the Soviet Union." The United States was concerned that the conflict might spread to other parts of the Middle East. President John F. Kennedy rushed off notes to Nasser, Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Hussein and Sallal. His plan was that Nasser's troops should withdraw from Yemen while Saudi Arabia and Jordan halted their aid to the Imam. Nasser agreed to pull out his forces only after Jordan and Saudi Arabia "stop all aggressive operations on the frontiers".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC8018203;The 1967 siege of Sana'a became the turning point of the war. The remaining republican Prime Minister succeeded in keeping control of Sana'a and by February 1968, the royalists lifted the siege. Clashes continued in parallel with peace talks until 1970, when Saudi Arabia recognised the Republic, and a ceasefire came into effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC8018204;The Yemenite War of 1972 was a short military conflict between the Yemen Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The war, initiated by the YAR, started on 26 September 1972, the tenth anniversary of the start of the North Yemen Civil War the fighting mostly consisted of border clashes. During the conflict, the YAR was supplied by Saudi Arabia and the PDRY by the USSR.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC8018205;The Yemenite War of 1979 was a short military conflict between the Yemen Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The war developed out of a breakdown in relations between the two countries after the president of North Yemen, Ahmad al-Ghashmi, was killed on 24 June 1978 and Salim Rubai Ali, a moderate Marxist who had been working on a proposed merger between the two Yemens, was murdered two days later. The hostility of the rhetoric from the new leadership of both countries escalated, leading to small scale border fighting, which then in turn escalated into a full blown war in February 1979. North Yemen appeared on the edge of a decisive defeat after a three-front invasion by South Yemeni combined arms formation, however this was prevented by a successful mediation in the form of the Kuwait Agreement of 1979, which resulted in Arab League forces being deployed to patrol the North-South border. An agreement to unite both countries was also signed, although was not implemented.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

He had been criticised by the people of $COUNTRY$ for failing to reform as promised and taking dictatorial actions. The pro-Russian opposition government which seized power surprised and disappointed Russia by calling for a widely popular referendum towards a democratic parliamentary system, the first of its kind in Central Asia.

EVT_8008103_DESC;In the south, ethnic Uzbeks have been highly active in the local economy. In $COUNTRYCULTURE$ public opinion, they have attempted to turn this economic clout into political power, promoting Uzbek nationalism, and destroying Kyrgyzstan's unity. During the general mayhem of the $YEAR$ Revolution, exiles from the Uzbek minority claim they were assaulted and driven to Uzbekistan, with some 400,000 citizens becoming internally displaced. Victims testify to mass killing, gang rape, and torture, primarily in the cities of Osh and Jalal-Abad. The violence required the interim government to declare a state of emergency in an attempt to take control of the situation. Uzbekistan launched a limited troop incursion early on, but withdrew and opened its borders to Uzbek refugees. The clashes killed nearly 420 people, mostly Uzbeks, and displaced another 80,000.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, the degree of support has been subject to debate, and accusations of greater involvement have been denied by Iran.

EVTDESC1410073;Badoglio was Chief of Staff from 1925 to 1940, an enormous length of time, and it was he who had the final say on the entire structure of the Armed Forces, including doctrine, selection of officers, armaments, for all that time, impregnating the whole military environment. Badoglio was not in favour of the Italian-German Pact of Steel and was pessimistic about the chances of Italian success in any European war but he did not oppose the decision of Mussolini and the King to declare war on France and Great Britain. Following the Italian army's poor performance in the invasion of Greece in December 1940, he resigned from the General Staff. Badoglio was replaced by Ugo Cavallero. Due to increased tensions with the Soviet Union, the British government saw Pietro Badoglio as a guarantor of an anti-communist post-war Italy. Consequently, Badoglio was never tried for Italian war crimes committed in Africa.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1410074;On March 4, 1948, charges against Graziani were presented to the United Nations War Crimes Commission. The commission was presented with evidence of the Italian policy of systematic terrorism and Graziani’s self-admitted intention to execute all Amharas authorities, and cited a telegram from Graziani to General Nasi, in which Graziani had written, “Keep in mind also that I have already aimed at the total destruction of Abyssinian chiefs and notables and that this should be carried out completely in your territories.” The UN commission agreed that there was a prima facie case against eight Italians, including Graziani. The British Foreign Office consistently opposed Ethiopia’s inclusion in the United Nations War Crimes Commission and the trial on Italian crimes committed during the 1935–1936 invasion. Ethiopian efforts to bring Graziani to trial were frustrated by intransigence from both Italy and Britain, the attempts were finally abandoned in a deal with the Foreign Office, whose support the Government of the Ethiopian Empire considered essential for its Imperial claim on Eritrea. In 1948, an Italian tribunal condemned Graziani to 19 years. However, he served only four months of his sentence, because his lawyers demonstrated that he "received orders".;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

Initially appointed to liquidate the agency, Mattei saw potential in the industry and decided to re-launch it, kickstarting a series of expeditions in search of oil throughout the whole country. Thanks to his ties to the ruling DC the industrialist has managed to secure special rights and monopolies on key new oil wells. Today the agency is not on the brink of collapse anymore and the eclectic Mattei has been trying to launch Italy on the global oil market, and to do so he urged the government to merge AGIP, ANIC and SNAM into a big oil conglomerate that could challenge the 'seven sisters' aka the one who formed the group Consortium for Iran and held a global hegemony over the market. This new conglomerate would take the name of ENI and to reach his goals Mattei has already started talks with middle eastern countries, his strategy would be to approach third world countries with more friendly treaties that would ensure equity between the buyer and the seller, upsetting the dominance of the sisters and defying American power. The plan is risky as it could damage relations with our western allies, but the immediate results would give a needed boost to the italian economy, some suggest to go on with the plan but to sideline Mattei, who has been concentrating too much power and whose influence on politics are too strong for a private individual, but we could also keep things as they are and not risk to upset global balances.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_32520_DESC;Republics of the Union have finally become free and independent, but despite their formally sovereign and independent status in the Union they were, in fact, mere administrative divisions, and their borders were sometimes made economically comfortable for the Union's authorities, rather then ethinically correct. In 1954, due to impossibility to adequately supply the Crimean peninsula with electricity, food and most of production from Russia, it was decided by Presidiums of Supreme Soviets of Russian SFSR and Ukrainian SSR to transfer ethnically diverse (but mostly Russian) peninsula from Russia to Ukraine. The thing is Presidiums had no right to do so without positive votes from the Supreme Councils. Whether there was such votes there are still speculations to these days. Nobody cared while we were parts of one country, but now we may get a conflict because of Russian-populated peninsula become a part of another country.

Public opinion in our colonies is also increasingly hostile towards continued colonialism. Even amongst our own people, there is a growing sense of resignation that maintaining a vast overseas empire is not only unjust but also disproportionately costly.

Clashes between communism and capitalism dominated the decade, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. The conflicts included the Korean War in the beginnings of the decade and the beginning of the Space Race with the launch of Sputnik I. Along with increased testing of nuclear weapons, this created a politically conservative climate. The beginning of decolonization in Africa and Asia occurred in 1950s and accelerated in the following decade. The 1960s have become synonymous with the new, radical, and subversive events and trends of the period, which continued to develop in the following decades. Several governments turned to the left in the early 1960s. In the United States, John F.

Yet, to the Chinese public, Mao Zedong proposed a belligerent attitude towards capitalist countries, an initial rejection of peaceful coexistence, which he perceived as Marxist revisionism from the Soviet Union. Moreover, since 1956, China and the USSR had progressively diverged about Marxist ideology, and, by 1961, when the doctrinal differences proved intractable, the Communist Party of China formally denounced the Soviet variety of Communism as a product of 'Revisionist Traitors', i.e., the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, headed by Nikita Krushchev.;;;;;;;;;;X

Since the demonstrations now incorporated a wide range of social groups with varying grievances. For its part, the government remained indecisive on how to deal with the situation, as its authority and legitimacy gradually eroded, with the hunger strikers now occupying moral high ground.;;;;;;;;;;X

The System was introduced by Walter Ulbricht to try to improve the performance of the existing central planning, so that the economy might be run in as efficient a manner as possible. Its main aims were to reduce the wastage of raw materials, increase the level of mechanisation used in production methods and, most significantly, to create a system in which quality rather than quantity was foremost. It was also used to rebuild the economy following the Republikflucht which had devastated the GDR's economy prior to the building of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961.

EVT_8006610_DESC;François Duvalier was the President of Haiti from 1957 until his death in 1971. Duvalier first won acclaim in fighting diseases, earning him the nickname 'Papa Doc'. He opposed a military coup d'état in 1950, and was elected President in 1957 on a populist and black nationalist platform. His rule, based on a purged military, a rural militia and the use of a personality cult and voodoo, resulted in the murder of an estimated 30,000 Haitians and an ensuing 'brain drain' from which the country has not recovered. Duvalier fostered a personality cult around himself, and claimed to be the physical embodiment of the island nation.;;;;;;;;;;X

The 25.000 Germans living in the Netherlands were branded as "hostile subjects", they were to be evicted in three groups in reverse order of entry. The first who had to leave were those who came after the start of the first world war (mostly factory workers), then those who came after 1932 (including political refugees, some of them Jews), and then the rest, many of whom were economic refugees from the 1920s. The operation started on 11 September 1946 in Amsterdam, where Germans and their families were taken from their homes in the middle of the night and given one hour to collect fifty kilograms of luggage. They were allowed to take one hundred Guilders, the rest of their possessions went to the state. They were taken to internment camps near the German border, the biggest of which was Mariënbosch near Nijmegen, from which they were evicted to the Britsch Zone of Occupation. With these newcomers being a burden on western germany, the British troops in Germany reacted by evicting the 100,000 Dutch citizens living near the border to the Netherlands.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8006707_DESC;The 1953 North Sea flood was a major flood caused by a heavy storm that occurred on the night of 31 January 1953 and morning of 1 February 1953. A combination of a high spring tide and a severe European windstorm over the North Sea caused a storm tide, the combination of wind, high tide, and low pressure led to a water level of more than 5.6 metres above mean sea level in some locations. The flood and waves overwhelmed sea defences and caused extensive flooding. The Netherlands, a country with 20% of its territory below mean sea level and 50% less than 1 metre above sea level and which relies heavily on sea defences, was worst affected, recording 1,836 deaths and widespread property damage. Most of the casualties occurred in the southern province of Zeeland. In England, 307 people were killed in the counties of Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. Nineteen were killed in Scotland. Twenty-eight people were killed in West Flanders, Belgium. In addition, more than 230 deaths occurred on water craft along Northern European coasts as well as on ships in deeper waters of the North Sea.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8006708_NAME;Depillarisation of our society;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_8006708_DESC;Pillarisation is the politico-denominational segregation of a society. These societies were (and in some areas, still are) "vertically" divided into several segments or "pillars" according to different religions or ideologies. The best-known examples of this are the Dutch and Belgian ones. These pillars all have their own social institutions: their own newspapers, broadcasting organisations, political parties, trade unions and farmers' associations, banks, schools, hospitals, universities, Scouting organisations and sports clubs. Some companies even hire only personnel of a specific religion or ideology. This leads to a situation where many people have no personal contact with people from another pillar. During the 1960s the pillars largely broke down, particularly under political criticism from D66 and the group New Left in PvdA. Because of this and of increased mobility, many people could see that people from the other pillars were not that different from themselves. Increased wealth and education made people independent of many of the pillarised institutions, and young people did not want to be associated with these organisations anymore.;;;;;;;;;;X

The last stages of the freedom struggle from the 1920s onwards saw Congress adopt Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's policy of nonviolence and civil resistance, Muhammad Ali Jinnah's constitutional struggle for the rights of minorities in India, and several other campaigns. Legendary figures such as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose later came to adopt a militant approach to the movement, while others like Swami Sahajanand Saraswati wanted both political and economic freedom for India's peasants and toiling masses. Poets including Rabindranath Tagore used literature, poetry and speech as a tool for political awareness.

EVT_8007270_DESC;Gandhi inherited a weak and troubled economy. Fiscal problems associated with the war with Pakistan in 1965, along with a drought-induced food crisis that spawned famines, had plunged India into the sharpest recession since independence. The government responded by taking steps to liberalize the economy, and by agreeing to the devaluation of the currency in return for the restoration of foreign aid. But, much of that growth was offset by the fact that the external aid promised never materialized. American policy makers had complained of continued restrictions imposed on the economy. At the same time, Indo-US relations were straining due to Gandhi's criticism of the American bombing campaign in Vietnam, and because of President Johnson's policy of withholding food grain shipments to coerce Indian support for the war. In light of the circumstances, liberalization and dependence on foreign aid became politically suspect and was soon abandoned.;;;;;;;;;;X

Indonesian military intelligence influenced the break-up of the alliance between two largest parties in East Timor, which led to a coup on 11 August 1975, and a month-long civil war. During this time, the Portuguese government effectively abandoned the territory, and did not resume the decolonisation process.

The Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference was held in The Hague from 23 August 1949 to 2 November 1949 between the Republic, the Netherlands, and the Dutch-created federal states. historically the Netherlands agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over a new federal state known as the 'United States of Indonesia' (RUSI).

The Border Campaign was the first major military undertaking carried out by the IRA since the 1940s, when the harsh security measures of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland governments had severely weakened the IRA. IRA Chief of Staff Tony Magan set out to create 'a new Army, untarnished by the dissent and scandals of the previous decade'. By the middle of this decade the IRA had substantially re-armed. This was achieved by means of arms raids launched between 1951 and 1954, on British military bases in Northern Ireland and England. The plan for the Border Campaign  codenamed ""Operation Harvest""  was devised by Seán Cronin. It envisaged the use of guerrilla units called flying columns, initially four units of about 50 men each. They were to operate from within the Republic of Ireland and to attack military and infrastructural targets within Northern Ireland. In addition, another twenty organisers were sent to various locations within Northern Ireland to train new units, gather intelligence and report back to the leadership in Dublin. An IRA stated that the aim of the campaign was to: 'break down the enemy’s administration in the occupied area until he is forced to withdraw his forces.';;;;;;;;;;X

Clann na Poblachta (led by former IRA Chief of Staff Seán MacBride) withdrew its support for the government in protest over this policy. In the ensuing Irish general election, 1957, Sinn Féin won four seats and polled 65,640 votes, while Clann na Poblachta's vote dropped sharply. Historically, the new government proved even more hostile to the IRA than its predecessor. In July 1957, after the killing of an RUC man, de Valera introduced wholesale internment without trial for IRA suspects. Then in November 1961 his Minister for Justice, Charles Haughey established military courts which handed down long prison sentences to convicted IRA men.

Partition occurred when the British Parliament passed the Government of Ireland Act 1920 creating Northern Ireland and what was then Southern Ireland. From 1801 to 1920 the whole island had formed a constituent country of the United Kingdom. Before then it was the separate Kingdom of Ireland. The Act of 1920 was intended to create two self-governing territories within Ireland that remained within the UK. The Act also contained provisions for co-operation between the two territories and for the eventual reunification of Ireland. However, partition was reinforced in 1922 when what was intended to be Southern Ireland separated from the United Kingdom as the Irish Free State. Since partition began, a key aspiration of Irish nationalists has been to bring about a united Ireland, with the whole island forming one independent state.

The creation of Malaysia was the amalgamation of the Federation of Malaya (now West Malaysia), Singapore and the crown colony/British protectorates of North Borneo and Sarawak (collectively known as British Borneo, now East Malaysia) in September 1963. The confrontation was an undeclared war with most of the action occurring in the border area between Indonesia and East Malaysia on the island of Borneo (known as Kalimantan in Indonesia). The conflict was characterised by restrained and isolated ground combat, set within tactics of low-level brinkmanship.

EVT_8011430_DESC;The White Revolution was a far-reaching series of reforms in Iran launched in 1963 by the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Mohammad Reza Shah’s reform program was built especially to strengthen those classes that supported the traditional system. The Shah advertised the White Revolution as a step towards modernization, but there is little doubt that the Shah also had political motives: the White Revolution (a name attributed to the fact it was bloodless) was a way for him to legitimize the Pahlavi dynasty. Part of the reason for launching the White Revolution was that the Shah hoped to get rid of the landlords' influence and create a new base of support among the peasants and working class. The bulk of the program was aimed at Iran’s peasantry, a class the Shah hoped to gain as an ally to thwart the threat of the increasingly hostile middle class. Thus the White Revolution in Iran represented a new attempt to introduce reform from above and preserve traditional power patterns.;;;;;;;;;;X

The reaction of the protesters to Black Friday, a violent government reaction to mass prostest, spread beyond quickly throughout the country, manifesting in the form of strikes.

The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army. Alongside Barre, the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) that assumed power after President Sharmarke's assassination was led by Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gabeyre Kediye and Chief of Police Jama Korshel. Kediye officially held the title of 'Father of the Revolution,' and Barre shortly afterwards became the head of the SRC.

Cominform was a Soviet-dominated organization of Communist parties founded in September 1947 at a conference of Communist party leaders in Szklarska Porêba, Poland. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin called the conference in response to divergences among eastern European governments on whether or not to attend the Paris Conference on Marshall Aid in July 1947. The initial seat of Cominform was located in Belgrade (then the capital of the Federative People's Republic of Yugoslavia). After the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the group in June 1948, the seat was moved to Bucharest, Romania.

The literal meaning of perestroika is 'restructuring', referring to the restructuring of the Soviet political and economic system. Perestroika allowed more independent actions from various ministries and introduced some market-like reforms. The goal of the perestroika, however, was not to end the command economy but rather to make socialism work more efficiently to better meet the needs of Soviet consumers. The process of implementing perestroika arguably exacerbated already existing political, social and economic tensions within the Soviet Union and no doubt helped to further nationalism in the constituent republics.

EVT_8014242_DESC;Gorbachev's economic changes did not do much to restart the country's sluggish economy in the late 1980s. The reforms decentralised things to some extent, although price controls remained, as did the ruble's inconvertibility and most government controls over the means of production. By 1990 the government had virtually lost control over economic conditions. Government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies continued. Tax revenues declined because republic and local governments withheld tax revenues from the central government under the growing spirit of regional autonomy. The elimination of central control over production decisions, especially in the consumer goods sector, led to the breakdown in traditional supply-demand relationships without contributing to the formation of new ones. Thus, instead of streamlining the system, Gorbachev's decentralisation caused new production bottlenecks.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8014249_DESC;The final round of the Soviet Union's collapse began with a Ukrainian popular referendum on 1 December 1991, wherein 90 percent of voters opted for independence. By nearly all accounts, the secession of the second-most powerful republic ended any realistic chance of the Soviet Union staying united even on a limited scale.  On 8 December 1991 the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus secretly met in Belavezhskaya Pushcha and signed the Belavezha Accords, which proclaimed the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and declared that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. They also invited the other republics to join. On 12 December, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR formally ratified the Belavezha Accords and denounced the 1922 Union Treaty. The Russian deputies were also recalled from the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. In effect, the largest and most powerful republic had seceded from the Union.

EVT_8014207_DESC;After Stalin died in March 1953, there was a period of uncertainty over the succession in the highest circles of power. On paper, Stalin was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev as the Party's First Secretary and Georgi Malenkov as Premier. However the central figure in the immediate post-Stalin period was the former head of the state security apparatus, Lavrentiy Beria. Beria, despite his record as part of Stalin's terror state, initiated a period of relative liberalization, including the release of some political prisoners. The leadership also began allowing some criticism of Stalin, saying that his one-man dictatorship went against the principles laid down by Lenin. Historically, the Politburo members disliked and feared Beria for his role under Stalin and with the support of the armed forces, had him arrested three months after Stalin's death.  In the post-Beria period, Khrushchev rapidly began to emerge as the key figure.;;;;;;;;;;X

Juan Carlos quickly instituted reforms, to the great displeasure of Falangist and conservative (monarchist) elements, especially in the military, who had expected him to maintain the authoritarian state. In July 1976, Juan Carlos dismissed prime minister Carlos Arias Navarro, who had been attempting to continue Francoist policies in the face of the king's attempts at progress.

The mutinies were suppressed, though survivors fled the towns and began an uncoordinated insurgency in rural areas. Poorly armed and ill-organized, they were little threat to the outgoing colonial power or the newly formed Sudanese government.

This growth was distributed fairly evenly across the economic classes, which some attribute to the strength of labor unions in this period—labor union membership peaked historically in the U.S. during the 1950s, in the midst of this massive economic growth. Much of the growth came from the movement of low income farm workers into better paying jobs in the towns and cities—a process largely completed by 1960. Congress created the Council of Economic Advisors, to promote high employment, high profits and low inflation. The Eisenhower administration (19531961) supported an activist contracyclical approach that helped to establish Keynesianism as a bipartisan economic policy for the nation.

Simultaneously, the pact bound the parties to limit Venezuela’s political system to an exclusive competition between two parties.

EVT_8023113_DESC;Jan Garrigue Masaryk was a Czech diplomat and politician and Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia from 1940 to 1948. When a Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile was established in Britain in 1940, Masaryk was appointed Foreign Minister and remained on the post following the liberation of Czechoslovakia as part of the multi-party, communist-dominated National Front government. In February 1948 the majority of the non-communist cabinet members resigned, hoping to force new elections, but instead a communist government under Gottwald was formed in what became known as the Czech coup. Masaryk remained Foreign Minister, and was the only prominent minister in the new government who wasn't either a Communist or a fellow traveler. However, he was apparently uncertain about his decision and possibly regretted his decision not to oppose the communist coup by broadcasting to the Czech people on national radio, where he was a much loved celebrity.;;;;;;;;;;X

Another 16 billion marks represented postwar loans by the U.S. Under the London Debts Agreement of 1953, the repayable amount was reduced by 50 percent to about 15 billion marks and stretched out over 30 years, and compared to the fast-growing German economy were of minor impact.;;;;;;;;;;X

Held between 20 November 1945 and 1 October 1946, the Tribunal was given the task of trying 23 of the most important political and military leaders of the Third Reich, though one of the defendants, Martin Bormann, was tried in absentia, while another, Robert Ley, committed suicide within a week of the trial's commencement. Not included were Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, and Joseph Goebbels, all of whom had committed suicide several months before the indictment was signed.

EVT_8226031_DESC;The city of Leningrad saw what is regarded as one of the greatest human tragedies of the entire War. Leningrad, one of the cities with a large amount of classical and baroque architecture on the Baltic Sea, was a city with a pre-war population of three million inhabitants. By August 1941, the Germans had reached the city's southern outskirts. Finnish forces had meanwhile recaptured the Karelian Isthmus North-West of the city. As the Gulf of Finland was blocked as well, Leningrad's only contact with the outer world was a vulnerable waterway across Lake Ladoga. Since taking the city seemed too costly to the Germans, in the light of bitter Soviet resistance, they instead began the Siege of Leningrad in order to starve the city to death. Soon, electricity, water and heating for civilian housing had to be shut down.;;;;;;;;;;X

The intensity and sheer scale of the battle of Stalingrad illustrate the ferocity of the German-Soviet War. Heavy German bombardment, killing thousands of civilians, had turned the city into a landscape of ruins. Workers of the city's weapons factories started personally handing over arms and ammunition to the defending soldiers as the Germans closed in, and eventually continued the fight themselves. Ever more Soviet troops were shipped into the city across the Volga River under enemy fire. German superiority in tanks became useless in the rubble of urban warfare. Fierce man-to-man fighting in streets, buildings and staircases continued for months. The Red Army moved its strategic reserve from Moscow to the lower Volga, and transferred all available aircraft from the entire country to the Stalingrad area. The Germans eventually lost a quarter of their total forces deployed on the Eastern Front, and never fully recovered from the defeat. The total casualties on both sides are estimated at nearly 2 million, within a period of 200 days.;;;;;;;;;;X

Having failed to take the city, Axis forces began a siege and heavy bombardment, with such unusual pieces of ordnance as the Mörser Karl self-propelled mortar, and the gigantic Schwerer Gustav railroad cannon. A second Axis offensive against the city, launched in December 1941, failed as well, as the Soviet army and navy forces continued to fight fiercely. Eventually the city was taken in June 1942.

EVT_8226035_DESC;At the gates of the Soviet capital, the German invaders suffered their first defeat in 1941. The advance of the German Army Group Centre came to a halt in late November 1941, at the outskirts of Moscow itself. The Soviet Government had by then been evacuated, yet Joseph Stalin remained in the city. Struggling between determination and despair, the city's population helped build defensive positions in the streets. The underground metro stations provided shelter during German air raids. General Georgy Zhukov, who assumed command of the city's defence, largely left close combat tactics to the local commanders on the city's approaches, and focused on concentrating fresh troops from Siberia for an eventual counter-attack. The Soviet counter-offensive was launched on 5 and 6 December 1941. In the freezing cold of an unusually harsh winter, Soviet forces, including well-equipped ski battalions, drove the exhausted Germans back out of reach of Moscow and consolidated their positions on 7 January 1942.

When the Germans commenced their offensive on 7 July, Soviet forces concentrated in the Kiev area were ordered to stand fast, and a breakout was prohibited. Defence of the pocket was fierce. Thousands of civilians volunteered to help defend the city. Eventually Kiev was taken on 19 September. Over 600,000 Soviet troops were taken captive when the pocket was cleared. The prolonged resistance effectively disrupted the German plans of blitzkrieg. However, in military terms, the battle was a great victory for the German Army and a disaster for the Soviets.

In May 1942 the Germans occupied the city again, yet Soviet partisan forces held out in the cliffs near the city until October 1942. On 31 October 1943 another Soviet naval landing was launched.

It was the only Soviet port on the Northern coast that did not freeze in the winter, and was vital for the transport of supplies to the South. German forces, including 800 Finns under German command, launched an offensive against Murmansk on 29 June 1941. More than 180,000 grenades and inflammable shells were fired on the city itself. Fierce Soviet resistance in the tundra and several Soviet counter-attacks made an Axis breakthrough impossible, however.

German armoured divisions of Army Group Centre began an offensive on July 10, 1941 to encircle Soviet forces in the Smolensk area. Soviet resistance was strong, and several counter-attacks were conducted. The Soviets even managed to temporarily break the German encirclement and to evacuate troops out of the pocket.

A dug-out for Joseph Stalin known as ""Stalin's Bunker"" was constructed but never used. As a leading industrial center, Kuybyshev played a major role in arming the country. From the very first months of World War II the city supplied the front with aircraft, firearms, and ammunition. The famous military parade of November 7, 1941 was held on the central square of the city. On March 5, 1942, Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony was first performed in the city's Opera and Ballet House by the Bolshoi Theater Orchestra conducted by S. A. Samosud. The symphony was broadcast all over the world. Health centers and most of the city's hospital facilities were turned into base hospitals.

EVT_8228001_DESC;After Japanese pulled out from Indochina in late 1945, the area was contested between various forces, some of them working towards a unifed independent Vietnamese state, some of them willing to recreate pre-war order. In January 1946, Vietnam had its first National Assembly election (won by the Viet Minh in central and northern Vietnam), which drafted the first constitution, but the French tried to regain power by force. An accord between France and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was made 6 March 1946 but difference of viewpoints made it difficult to work together for the benefit of Vietnam. It was clear that the war between Viet Minh forces and France will break soon. Realizing that colonialism was coming to an end worldwide, France fashioned a semi-independent State of Vietnam, within the French Union, with Emperor Bao Dai as Head of State.;;;;;;;;;;X

The French representative was present on board of USS Missouri when Japanese surrender was made. However, American President Franklin D. Roosevelt and General Joseph Stilwell privately made it adamantly clear that the French were not to reacquire French Indochina after the war was over.

EVT_8228003_DESC;Acting upon American tacit agreement, 200 000 troops of the Chinese 1st Army arrived in what would become North Vietnam (Indochina above the 16th parallel). They had been sent by Chiang Kai-shek under General Lu Han to accept the surrender of Japanese occupying forces occupying that area which had been designated to Chiang Kai-Shek. The Chinese forces initially kept the French Colonial soldiers interned with the acquiescence of the Americans. The Chinese used the VNQDD, the Vietnamese branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, to increase their influence in Indochina and put pressure on their opponents. Chiang Kai-shek threatened the French with war in response to manoeuvering by the French and Ho Chi Minh against each other, forcing them to come to a peace agreement, and in February 1946 he also forced the French to surrender all of their concessions in China and renounce their extraterritorial privileges. This was done in exchange for withdrawing from northern Indochina and allowing French troops to reoccupy the region but if Chinese insisted on coercing Indochina into their sphere of influence, they would be very hard to stop.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8228005_DESC;At the beginning of the war, the U.S. was neutral in the conflict because of opposition to imperialism, because the Viet Minh had recently been their allies, and because most of its attention was focused on Europe. Then the U.S. government gradually began supporting the French in their war effort, primarily through Mutual Defense Assistance Act, as a means of stabilizing the French Fourth Republic in which the French Communist Party was a significant political force. A dramatic shift occurred in American policy after the victory of Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China in the Chinese Civil War. After the MochMarshall meeting of September 23, 1950, in Washington, the United States started to support the French Union effort politically, logistically and financially. Officially, US involvement did not include use of armed force, at least not openly nor on large scale until 1960s.;;;;;;;;;;X

Military historian Martin Windrow wrote that Battle of Dien Bien Phu, at the end of the war, was 'the first time that a non-European colonial independence movement had evolved through all the stages from guerrilla bands to a conventionally organized and equipped army able to defeat a modern Western occupier in pitched battle.';;;;;;;;;;X

The VNA fought in joint operations with the French Union's French Far East Expeditionary Corps against the communist Viet Minh forces led by Ho Chi Minh. Benefiting with French assistance the VNA quickly became a modern army modelled after the Expeditionary Corps. It included infantry, artillery, transmission, armored cavalry, airborne, airforce, navy and a national military academy.

In a later interview General Marcel Bigeard argued that 'one of the deepest mistakes done by the French during the war was the propaganda telling you are fighting for Freedom, you are fighting against Communism'. In the latest days of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, 652 non-paratrooper soldiers from all army corps from cavalry to infantry to artillery dropped for the first and last time of their life to support their comrades. The Cold War excuse was later used by General Maurice Challe through his famous 'Do you want Mers El Kebir & Algiers to become Soviet bases as soon as tomorrow?', during the Algerian War of 1961, with limited effect though.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8228030_DESC;Throughout the war theater, the Viet Minh cut French supply lines and began to seriously wear down the resolve of the French forces. There were continued raids, skirmishes and guerrilla attacks, but through most of the rest of the year each side withdrew to prepare itself for larger operations. The Battle of Na San saw the first use of the French commanders 'hedgehog' tactics consisting in setting up a well defended outpost to get the Viet Minh out of the jungle and force it to fight a conventional battle instead of ambushes. In late November and early December 1952, Giap attacked the French outpost at Na San, which was essentially an 'air-land base', a fortified camp supplied only by air. Giap's forces were beaten back repeatedly with very heavy losses. The French hoped that by repeating the strategy on a much larger scale, they would be able to lure Giap into committing the bulk of his forces in a massed assault. This would enable superior French artillery, armor, and air support to decimate the exposed Viet Minh forces. The experience at Na San convinced the French of the viability of the fortified airhead concept.;;;;;;;;;;X

Both of these programs attempted to separate rural peasants from Communist insurgents by creating communities that in some ways resembled concentration camps. The program led to a decrease in support for Diem’s regime and an increase in sympathy for Communist efforts.

The aim of this policy was to create outposts behind advancing Chinese troops to interdict their supplies, forcing them north of the disputed line. There were eventually 60 such outposts, including 43 north of the McMahon Line, to which India claimed sovereignty. China viewed this as further confirmation of Indian expansionist plans directed towards Tibet.

Much related equipment was moved too, the aim being to virtually transplant research and production centres, such as the relocated V-2 rocket centre at Mittelwerk Nordhausen, from Germany to the Soviet Union. The codename 'Osoaviakhim' was the acronym of a Soviet paramilitary organisation, later renamed DOSAAF. The operation was commanded by NKVD deputy Colonel General Serov, outside the control of the local Soviet Military Administration (which in a few cases, such as Carl Zeiss AG, tried to prevent the removal of specialists and equipment of vital economic significance for the occupation zone). The operation took 92 trains to transport the specialists and their families (perhaps 10,000-15,000 people in all) along with their furniture and belongings. Whilst those removed were offered generous contracts (the specialists were told that they would be paid on the same terms as equivalent Soviet workers, which in post-war Germany was seen as a gain), there was little doubt that failing to sign them was not a realistic option.;;;;;;;;;;X

De Gaulle's Appeal of 18 June exhorted the French people not to be demoralised and to continue to resist the occupation of France and work against the collaborationist Vichy regime, which had signed an armistice with Nazi Germany. Although the original speech could only be heard in a few parts of occupied France, de Gaulle's subsequent ones reached many parts of the territories under the Vichy regime, helping to rally the French resistance movement and earning him much popularity amongst the French people and soldiers. In Algiers in 1943, Eisenhower gave De Gaulle the assurance in person that a French force would liberate Paris and arranged that the army division of French General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque would be transferred from North Africa to England to carry out that liberation.

Examples of anglophilia in German media was a long article in the Berliner Illustriete Zeitung newspaper in 1936 extolling the British for ""brutally"" resolving the Fashoda crisis of 1898 in their favor or a series of widely promoted biographies and historical novels commemorating various prominent ""Aryan"" figures from British history such as Cromwell, Marlborough, Nelson, Rhodes, Wellington, and Raleigh.;;;;;;;;;;X

In 1921, the Scots National League formed as a body primarily based in London seeking Scottish independence, largely influenced by Sinn Féin.

The revised final terms were signed by Neville Chamberlain on 28 June 1940 and sent to Éamon de Valera. On their rejection, neither the London or Dublin governments publicised the matter. Ireland/Éire would effectively join the allies against Germany by allowing British ships to use its ports, arresting Germans and Italians, setting up a joint defence council and allowing overflights. In return, arms would be provided to Éire and British forces would cooperate on a German invasion.

While Hitler cited Mussolini as an influence and expressed privately great admiration for him, Mussolini had little regard for Hitler, especially after the Nazis had assassinated his friend and ally, Engelbert Dollfuss the Austrofascist dictator of Austria in 1934. With the assassination of Dollfuss, Mussolini attempted to distance himself from Hitler by rejecting much of the racialism espoused by the German radical. By 1938 however, the enormous influence Hitler now had over Mussolini became clear with the introduction of the Manifesto of Race by Mussolini, adopting similar racial overtones. It has been widely speculated that Mussolini's reasoning to adopt the Manifesto of Race in 1938 was merely tactical, in order to strengthen Italy's relations with Germany.;;;;;;;;;;X

He remained emphatically neutral in the Second World War, but nonetheless offered various kinds of support to Italy and Germany. He allowed Spanish soldiers to volunteer to fight in the German Army against the USSR (the Blue Division), but forbade Spaniards to fight in the West against the democracies. Franco's common ground with Hitler was particularly weakened by Hitler's propagation of Nazi mysticism and his attempts to manipulate Christianity, which went against Franco's fervent commitment to defending Christianity and Catholicism. Yet, after the collapse of France in June 1940, Spain did adopt a pro-Axis non-belligerency stance (for example, he offered Spanish naval facilities to German ships) until returning to complete neutrality in 1943 when the tide of the war had turned decisively against Germany and its allies.;;;;;;;;;;X

The party's staunch opposition to American involvement in World War I, although welcomed by many, also led to prominent defections, official repression and vigilante persecution.

EVT_8500214_DESC;The practical effect of this Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was that it effectively strengthened Castro's position in Cuba, guaranteeing that the US would not invade Cuba.

EVT_8500315_DESC;The operation, aimed at taking control of the Suez Canal, Gaza, and parts of Sinai, was highly successful for the invaders from a military point of view, but was a disaster from a political point of view, resulting in international criticism and diplomatic pressure. Along with the Suez crisis, the United States was also dealing with the near-simultaneous Hungarian revolution. Vice-President Richard Nixon later explained: "We couldn't on one hand, complain about the Soviets intervening in Hungary and, on the other hand, approve of the British and the French picking that particular time to intervene against Nasser". Beyond that, it was Eisenhower's belief that if the United States were seen to acquiesce in the attack on Egypt, that the resulting backlash in the Arab world might win the Arabs over to the Soviet Union. On 30 October, the Security Council held a meeting, at the request of the United States, when it submitted a draft resolution calling upon Israel immediately to withdraw its armed forces behind the established armistice lines.

In this conflict, the PRC shelled the islands of Kinmen and the Matsu Islands along the east coast of mainland China (in the Taiwan Strait) to "liberate" Taiwan from the Chinese Nationalist Party, also known as the Kuomintang (KMT) and to probe the extent of the United States defense of Taiwan's territory.

A blacksmith in Quemoy generally produces 60 cleavers from one bomb shell and tourists often purchase Kinmen knives as souvenirs together with other local products. On August 24 and 25, 1958 Chinese Communist and Chinese Nationalist forces clashed in the vicinity of Dongding Island, which the Nationalist troops controlled. The action was seen as an attempt by the communists to land on the island. This was the only naval and amphibious landing action during the crisis.

Since Romania did not have riot police (Ceaucescu, who genuinely believed that the Romanian people loved him, never saw the need for them), the military were sent in to control the riots because the situation was too large for the Securitate and conventional police to handle.

Roughly eight minutes into his speech, several people began jeering and booing, and others began chanting "Timisoara!" He tried to silence them by raising his right hand and calling for the crowd's attention before order was temporarily restored, then proceeded to announce social benefit reforms that included raising the national minimum wage by 200 lei per month to a total of 2,200 per month by 1 January. Failing to control the crowd, the Ceausescus finally took cover inside the building that housed the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party. The rest of the day saw an open revolt of Bucharest's population, which had assembled in University Square and confronted the police and army at barricades. The rioters, however, were no match for the military apparatus concentrated in Bucharest, which cleared the streets by midnight and arrested hundreds of people in the process.

Soon though, Dubcek declared the party's mission was 'to build an advanced socialist society on sound economic foundations ... a socialism that corresponds to the historical democratic traditions of Czechoslovakia, in accordance with the experience of other communist parties ...' In April, Dubcek launched an 'Action Programme' of liberalizations, which included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of movement, with economic emphasis on consumer goods and the possibility of a multiparty government. The programme was based on the view that 'Socialism cannot mean only liberation of the working people from the domination of exploiting class relations, but must make more provisions for a fuller life of the personality than any bourgeois democracy.' It would limit the power of the secret police and provide for the federalization of Czechoslovakia into two equal nations. The programme also covered foreign policy, including both the maintenance of good relations with Western countries and cooperation with the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc nations.

The expressed intention of the Federation was to create a political unit that would become independent from Britain as a single state—possibly similar to the Canadian Confederation, Australian Commonwealth, or Central African Federation; however, before that could happen, the Federation collapsed due to internal political conflicts. The territories of the federation eventually became the nine contemporary sovereign states of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago; with Anguilla, Montserrat, the Cayman Islands, and Turks and Caicos Islands becoming British overseas territories.;;;;;;;;;;X

Setting up a system of rules, institutions, and procedures to regulate the international monetary system, these accords established the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which today is part of the World Bank Group.

In the 1970s and 1980s, assistance from Comecon had been directed toward export-oriented industries. Third World countries had paid for this support with products, produced by the project for which Comecon rendered help.

EVT_15611_DESC;The Anglo-American Loan Agreement was a post World War II loan made to the United Kingdom by the United States on 15 July 1946.The loan was made primarily to cover liability incurred by Britain in the war to the US, as well as support British overseas expenditure in the immediate post-war years and not to implement the Labour government's welfare reforms. British treasury officials believed they could implement the Labour government's domestic reforms without the loan if Britain withdrew from all major overseas commitments. The loan was made subject to conditions, the most damaging of which was the convertibility of sterling. Though not the intention, the effect of convertibility was to worsen British post-war economic problems. International sterling balances became convertible one year after the loan was ratified, on 15 July 1947. Within a month, nations with sterling balances (e.g. pounds which they had earned from buying British exports, and which they were now permitted to sell to Britain in exchange for dollars) had drawn almost a billion dollars from British dollar reserves, forcing the British government to suspend convertibility and to begin immediate drastic cuts in domestic and overseas expenditure.

Due to censorship by the national government, the Ashgabat earthquake was not much reported in the USSR's media. Historians tend to agree that the ban on reporting the extent of the earthquake casualties and damages did not allow the Soviet government to allocate enough financial resources to adequately respond to the disaster. US Admiral Ellis M. Zacharias, former Deputy Chief of The Office Of Naval Intelligence, on his radio show Secret Missions (twice, on December 12, 1948, and on September 26, 1949), purported that the cause of the earthquake was the first Soviet atomic bomb test.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_101936_DESC;Islamism, also known as Political Islam, is a set of ideologies holding that "Islam should guide social and political as well as personal life." Islamism is a controversial concept not just because it posits a political role for Islam but also because its most extreme advocates believe their Islamic views are superior to all others', and that the contrary idea that Islam is, or can be, apolitical is an error.[citation needed] Islamists can have varying interpretations on various Quranic suras and ayahs. Islamist views emphasize the implementation of Sharia (Islamic law); of pan-Islamic political unity; and of the selective removal of non-Muslim, particularly Western military, economic, political, social, or cultural influences in the Muslim world that they believe to be incompatible with Islam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_1014840_NAME;Salafi jihadism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1014840_DESC;Jihad has been propagated in modern fundamentalism beginning in the late 19th century, an ideology that arose in the context of struggles against colonial powers in North Africa in the late 19th century, as in the Mahdist War in Sudan, and notably in the mid-20th century by Islamic revivalist authors such as Sayyid Qutb and Abul Ala Maududi. The term jihadism (earlier Salafi jihadism) has arisen in the 2000s to refer to the contemporary jihadi movements, the development of which was in retrospect traced to developments of Salafism paired with the origins of al-Qaeda in the Soviet–Afghan War during the 1990s. Jihadism has been called an "offshoot" of Islamic revivalism of the 1960s and 1970s. The writings of Sayyid Qutb and Mohammed Abdul-Salam Farag provide inspiration. The Soviet–Afghan War (1979–1989) is said to have "amplified the jihadist tendency from a fringe phenomenon to a major force in the Muslim world.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_8014730_DESC;The Syrian Civil War, also known as the Syrian Uprising, is an ongoing armed conflict taking place in Syria. The unrest began in the early spring of 2011 within the context of Arab Spring protests, with nationwide protests against President Bashar al-Assad's government, whose forces responded with violent crackdowns. The conflict gradually morphed from prominent protests to an armed rebellion after months of military sieges. The Ghouta chemical attack occurred on 21 August 2013 during the Syrian Civil War, when several opposition-controlled areas in the suburbs around Damascus, Syria were struck by rockets containing the chemical agent sarin. Hundreds were killed in the attack, which took place over a short span of time in the early morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_11270_NAME;Demand for Sharia Legal and court proceedings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_11270_DESC;Sharia judicial proceedings have significant differences from other legal traditions, including those in both common law and civil law. Sharia courts traditionally do not rely on lawyers; plaintiffs and defendants represent themselves. Trials are conducted solely by the judge, and there is no jury system. There is no pre-trial discovery process, and no cross-examination of witnesses. Unlike common law, judges' verdicts do not set binding precedents under the principle of stare decisis, and unlike civil law, sharia is left to the interpretation in each case and has no formally codified universal statutes. The rules of evidence in sharia courts also maintain a distinctive custom of prioritizing oral testimony. Witnesses, in a sharia court system, must be faithful, that is Muslim. Male Muslim witnesses are deemed more reliable than female Muslim witnesses, and non-Muslim witnesses considered unreliable and receive no priority in a sharia court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_11280_DESC;Much of the study in the madrasah college centred on examining whether certain opinions of law were orthodox. This scholarly process of "determining orthodoxy began with a question which the Muslim layman, called in that capacity mustaft, presented to a jurisconsult, called mufti, soliciting from him a response, called fatwa, a legal opinion (the religious law of Islam covers civil as well as religious matters). The mufti (professor of legal opinions) took this question, studied it, researched it intensively in the sacred scriptures, in order to find a solution to it. This process of scholarly research was called ijtihid, literally, the exertion of one's efforts to the utmost limit.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_15300_DESC;Originally founded in 1862 as a Czech gymnastics movement in Prague, the Sokol movement soon spread further to other Slavic countries. While in theory a non-partisan organisation, the Sokol movement was in practice an important vehicle for the furthering of Czech nationalism and, later on, pan-slavic thought and ideology.

EVT_22613_DESC;Having children, raising them, and socialization with neighbors and relatives are the greatest functions of the Amish family. Amish believe large families are a blessing from God. Two key concepts for understanding Old Order Mennonite practices are their rejection of Hochmut (pride, arrogance, haughtiness) and the high value they place on Demut (humility) and Gelassenheit (calmness, composure, placidity), often translated as "submission" or "letting-be". Gelassenheit is perhaps better understood as a reluctance to be forward, to be self-promoting, or to assert oneself. The Old Order Mennonite's willingness to submit to the "Will of Jesus", expressed through group norms, is at odds with the individualism so central to the wider American culture. The Old Order Mennonite anti-individualist orientation is the motive for rejecting labor-saving technologies that might make one less dependent on community.

The arrest was followed by purported investigations into taxation returns filed by Yukos, and a delay in the antitrust commission's approval of its merger with Sibneft. According to "Moscow Echo" radio poll, Khodorkovsky would gain 38% of votes in presidential elections, Putin - 14%. He refused to stop financing oppositional parties Yabloko, Union of Right Forces and the Communist Party when Putin demanded it from him. He was the richest person in the country at the moment. On the morning of 25 October 2003, Khodorkovsky was arrested at the Novosibirsk airport. He was taken to Moscow and charged with fraud, tax evasion, and other economic crimes. Gessen describes the trial as a “travesty” and “a Kafka-esque procedure,” with the government spending months “on an incoherent account of alleged violations that were criminalized after they were committed, or that were in fact legal activities.” In preparing the case, the government called in Yukos employees for questioning.

Überall und billig erhältliche Branntweine in Kombination mit harten Arbeitsbedingungen lassen die ärmeren Klassen besonders gerne zu diesem tödlichen Gift greifen. Es ist nicht überraschend, dass in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ eine Abstinenzlerliga gebildet wurde.;;Con los estragos del alcohol cobrándose su precio cada día en nuestro pueblo, desgastando el entramado espiritual de nuestro carácter nacional cada día con renovada intensidad, resulta imperativo que nos unamos en defensa de la virtud pública para educar y elevar a los pobres y oprimidos a las virtudes de la templanza.\n\nDesde hace algún tiempo, nuestro país ha tenido que enfrentarse a un aumento gradual en el consumo de alcohol. Los licores destilados, baratos y fáciles de obtener, en combinación con las míseras condiciones laborales, hacen a las clases más pobres especialmente susceptibles a este letal envenenamiento. No es de extrañar que se haya formado una Liga para la Templanza $COUNTRY_ADJ$.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC100001;The relative quiet of the Cold War was broken with a crashing revelry in $YEAR$, as liberal agitation erupted into open revolution across the Soviet Bloc. The dictatoral regimes of the world could only look on in horror and disgust, as the hymns of the liberal revolution could again be heard echoing from the tumultuous streets, and student's and youth again gathered under republican tricolors, celebrating the ideals, dreams and wishes of a young generation, animated by the powerful message of human liberty -- in economic, cultural, social and national affairs -- that was beginning of a new age of Liberalism.;La relative quiétude du début du XIXe siècle fut interrompue par les festivités tonitruantes de $YEAR$ lorsqu'une agitation libérale se transforma en révolution ouverte sur tout le continent. Les anciens régimes monarchiques européens ne pouvaient qu'y assister, avec horreur et dégoût, tandis que les chants de la Révolution française trouvèrent un nouvel écho dans les rues tumultueuses de l'Europe et que la jeunesse se réunissait sous les bannières tricolores pour célébrer les idéaux, rêves et souhaits de la nouvelle génération, animée par le puissant message de liberté, en termes économiques, culturels, sociaux et nationaux, que représentant le libéralisme européen.;Die relative Ruhe des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts wurde im Jahr $YEAR$ mit einem großen Knall beendet, als sich auf dem ganzen Kontinent liberale Bewegungen in offene Revolutionen verwandelten. Die Monarchien Europas konnten nur entsetzt und voller Verachtung zusehen, wie die Hymnen der französischen Revolution von den Straßen ganz Europas widerhallten, und sich Studenten und Jugendliche wieder unter der republikanischen Trikolore versammelten, um ihre Ideale, Träume und Wünsche zu feiern. Hinter all dem stand die mächtige Botschaft von der menschlichen Freiheit -- in wirtschaftlichen, kulturellen, sozialen und nationalen Angelegenheiten -- der europäische Liberalismus.;;La relativa tranquilidad de principios del siglo XIX se vio sacudida por una fuerte sacudida en $YEAR$, a medida que la agitación liberal se convertía en revolución abierta a lo largo del continente. Los antiguos regímenes monárquicos de Europa solo podían oír con horror y desagrado como volvía el eco de los himnos de la Revolución Francesa en las tumultuosas calles de Europa. Los estudiantes y la juventud volvían a reunirse bajo las banderas tricolores para celebrar los ideales, sueños y deseos de una nueva generación animada por el poderoso mensaje de libertad humana en todos los campos, económico, cultural, social y nacional. Era el liberalismo europeo.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100000;"Apartheid is the name for the policies by which the white minority of South Africa, represented by the National Party, segregated indigenous black Africans and other non-white populations from white Afrikaners. Non-white South Africans were stripped of South African citizenship and made citizens of the ten ""bantustans"", meant to be tribal homelands for black Africans. Several of these bantustans, including Ciskei and Transkei, were proclaimed by South Africa to be independent, though they were not recognized internationally.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100001;The electoral victory of a coalition of anti-Apartheid parties has resulted in the reversal of the National Party's discriminatory policies and the acceptance of South Africa's black African majority as a vital part of South Africa's societal fabric.

EVTDESC100011;With the fall of the USSR and the triumph of western democracy over communistic autocracy, the fundamental ideas that began in the French Revolution and reliterated in the latest Soviet Revolution have once more emerged victorious. Everywhere in world, in coffeehouses and universities, the ideas of liberalism, political reform, freedom of speech, and the rights of peoples, rather than of monarchs or despots, are proving again the old proverb that there is no stopping an idea whose time has come. Minorities long yoked under crowns and boots, are waking up to the realisation that fate is theirs to make, and, across far away oceans, the riches of democracy and capitalism beckon. As the dust settles on Red Square, the world stands again at the beginning of a new era: An age of Liberalism.;Alors que Napoléon et ses armées ont été vaincus, les idées fondamentales de la Révolution française perdurent. En Allemagne, les vieilles couronnes du Saint-Empire romain ont été réduites à néant et les contrats féodaux d'antan ont été remplacés par des codes civils napoléoniens. Partout en Europe, dans les cafés comme dans les universités, les idées du libéralisme, de la réforme politique, de la liberté d'expression et des droits des citoyens plutôt que des droits des monarques attestent du fait que le temps est en marche. Les minorités, longtemps sous le joug des royautés, se réveillent et réalisent que leur destin est entre leurs mains et, au-delà des océans, les richesses de l'Afrique et de l'Asie leur tendent les bras. Alors que le souvenir de Waterloo s'estompe, l'Europe est à l'aube d'une ère nouvelle :\nl'ère du libéralisme.;Während Napoleon und seine Armeen besiegt wurden, sind die fundamentalen Ideen der französischen Revolution noch sehr wohl am Leben. In Deutschland wurden die Königshäuser des Heiligen Römischen Reichs Deutscher Nation gestürzt und althergebrachte feudale Verträge durch napoleonisches Bürgerrecht ersetzt. Überall in Europa, in Kaffeehäusern und Universitäten, beweisen die Ideen von Liberalismus, politischen Reformen, Meinungsfreiheit und Bürgerrecht im Gegensatz zum monarchischen Absolutismus die Wahrheit der alten Redensart, dass nichts eine Idee aufhalten kann, deren Zeit gekommen ist. Lange haben Minderheiten unter dem Joch von Kronen und Zeptern gelitten. Nun beginnen sie zu realisieren, dass sie selbst über ihre eigene Zukunft bestimmten können, und jenseits riesiger Ozeane locken die Reichtümer Afrikas und Asiens. Während sich der Staub über Waterloo langsam setzt, steht Europa schon wieder am Beginn eines neuen Zeitalters: einem Zeitalter des Liberalismus.;;Aunque Napoleón y sus ejércitos han sido derrotados, las ideas fundamentales de la Revolución Francesa perduran. En Alemania, no queda nada de las viejas coronas del Sacro Imperio Romano, y los antiguos contratos feudales son sustituidos por códigos civiles napoleónicos. En toda Europa, desde cafés a universidades, las ideas del liberalismo, la reforma política, la libertad de expresión y los derechos de las gentes en vez de los de sus monarcas demuestran el viejo proverbio de que nada puede detener una idea cuando llega su momento. Las minorías que durante mucho tiempo han estado subyugadas bajo las coronas y los cetros, están empezando a darse cuenta de que de ellas depende la consecución de su destino y, más allá de los océanos, les esperan las riquezas de África y Asia. Mientras el polvo se asienta en Waterloo, Europa se levanta de nuevo al inicio de una nueva era: una época de liberalismo.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1010011;For years, British committees have looked into the situation in Ireland and predicted disaster: the Irish farmers had become more and more dependent on their potato crop, and if anything were to happen to that crop it would cause not only widespread chaos throughout the Irish economy but famine and worse. Their predictions have come true. A blight has been spreading, leading to failure after failure of the Irish potato harvest. Proponents of laissez faire economics are adamant that the market will provide food for those affected, and that the government should not interfere in private enterprise. Others claim that no expense is too high to help the Irish, and that failure to act quickly will lead to starvation and resentment... but conservatives are quick to dismiss this as inflammatory nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1010015;An aborted attempt at an uprising recently took place in the village of Ballingarry, Ireland. A group of Irish nationalists, frustrated by what they call the inept handling of the recent famine by the British government, engaged in a long gunfight with a unit of constabulary until reinforcements arrived and drove the men off.

EVTDESC1010024;Spurred on by increased public sympathy towards the Irish Republican Brotherhood following the Easter Rising, the Sinn Féin have won a majority of seats in Ireland during the last election. They have gathered in Dublin and declared themselves Dáil Éireann, the parliament of Ireland, and demanded that Ireland be granted immediate full independence.

EVTDESC1010030;An Anglo-Irish politician by the name of Charles Stewart Parnell has just been elected to Parliament. Some are describing him as a firebrand and nationalist agitator, while others suggest he's a man of remarkable charisma and organizational talent-- able to take on the entirety of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political system in order to push his Irish Home Rule agenda and succeed. It's very possible that this man could single-handedly turn the tide of opinion on the subject of Home Rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1010031;With Charles Stewart Parnell putting forward his Home Rule agenda, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens in $PROVINCENAME$ have become increasingly concerned that they might end up in an independent Irish state-- one dominated by Irish catholics in Dublin.

EVTDESC1010032;Charles Stewart Parnell has been successfully advancing his Home Rule Bill through Parliament, and while it is continually being held up by opposition from the Upper House, there is a sense that the man is managing to convince $COUNTRY_ADJ$ law-makers who-- in the not-too-distant past-- might have said that Home Rule was unthinkable./n/nNow we must consider whether his vision will see the light of day: do we grant Ireland the status of an autonomous Dominion under our control, or put this aside and face renewed violence among the Irish?

Since the authorities have no leads, members of our primary culture have taken it upon themselves to seek retribution on the minority and anti-minority sentiments are becoming widespread. The local government has turned a blind eye to the whole matter and let the attacks of retribution be carried out. Many people in $STATENAME$ are now calling for severe restrictions to be placed upon the minorities in the nation.

A banana boat has just docked in one of our harbors, and our citizens marvel at the sweetness and strange looks of this amazing new fruit, previously unknown to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ public, as it is being unloaded by the crateload.

The proposal concerns one of our colonies, where several acres of viable farmland could potentially be exploited more efficiently under new and industrialized forms of agriculture. Naturally, this proposal would require the expropriation by the state of said land, to then be sold at a fair market price to the interests of capital. Mere technicalities, am I right?;Donc, vous voyez, si $CAPITAL$ pourrait, peut-être, être en mesure de nous prêter main forte dans cette petite entreprise qu'est la nôtre, nous serions très, très heureux. \n\nLe gouvernement a été approché par plusieurs éminents membres de l'élite industriel du pays, qui croient qu'ils ont trouvé un nouveau racket profitable où tremper leurs doigts. La proposition porte sur l'une de nos colonies, où plusieurs hectares de terres agricoles viables pourraient être exploitées plus efficacement sous des formes nouvelles et industrialisées d'agriculture. Naturellement, cette proposition nécessiterait l'expropriation par l'état de ladite terre, pour être ensuite vendue à un prix de marché équitable pour les interêts de leur capital. Techniques simples, n'est-ce pas ? ;Hmmh, also, wenn uns $CAPITAL$ vielleicht bei unserer kleinen Unternehmung unterstützen könnte, wären wir wirklich sehr erfreut.'\n\nMehrere führende Mitglieder der industriellen Elite des Landes, die glauben, eine neue profitable Geschäftsidee gefunden zu haben, sind mit der Regierung in Kontakt getreten. Ihr Vorschlag betrifft eine unserer Kolonien, in der mehrere Hektar rentablen Ackerlandes durch die Einführung neuer und industrialisierter Bewirtschaftungsmethoden effizienter genutzt werden könnten. Natürlich würde dieser Vorschlag die Zwangsenteignung dieser Ländereien durch den Staat bedeuten, worauf es für einen fairen Marktpreis an die Industriellen verkauft werden würde. Das ist doch reine Formsache, oder?;;Así que, quizá, si $CAPITAL$ pudiera, ya sabe, echarnos una mano en este pequeño proyecto nuestro, estaríamos muy agradecidos.\n\nEl gobierno ha recibido la propuesta de diversos miembros de la élite industrial del país, quienes creen haber encontrado un posible nuevo negocio provechoso en el que meter mano. La propuesta afecta a una de nuestras colonias, donde varios acres de tierra cultivable podrían ser explotados de forma más eficaz bajo nuevas formas de agricultura industrializada. Naturalmente, esta propuesta requeriría la expropiación de dicha tierra por parte del estado, para ser vendida posteriormente a un precio razonable a los intereses del capital.

We were not invited to the colonies, and, frankly, I find our presence in them to be rude.'\n\nAn anti-colonial malaise has taken hold in $COUNTRY$, where more and more of our people are beginning to question our colonial ambitions. The colonies are increasingly being seen more as burdens than as boons, and this situation is beginning to hamper our ability to motivate them before the general public.;et ce que je n'arrive pas à comprendre, c'est pourquoi notre gouvernement insiste avec des paiements, de milliers sinon de millions, de livres chaque année, pour maintenir des projets impérialistes à l'étranger qui ne servent qu'à contraindre notre budget national.

EVTDESC14760;A slowly unraveling corruption scandal in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonial Office shakes $CAPITAL$, as a major newspaper publishes reports detailing an extensive network of bribes and favors, designed to give certain private interests preferential treatment with regards to colonial trade and exploitation. Critics of government policy point to the relatively low wages and poor funds alotted to colonial officials as determining reasons for the scandal, while the prevailing mood in government circles seems to be that a culture of corruption within the private sector is to blame for the poor state of the Colonial Office.;Un scandale de corruption latente au sein du Bureau colonial $COUNTRY_ADJ$ secoue $CAPITAL$ alors qu'un éminent journal publie des rapports détaillant un important réseau de corruptions et de faveurs mis en place pour favoriser certains intérêts privés en termes de commerce et d'exploitation coloniaux. Les critiques proférées à l'égard de la politique gouvernementale pointent du doigt les bas salaires et piètres fonds alloués aux fonctionnaires coloniaux comme les raisons déterminantes du scandale, alors que la tendance prédominante au sein des cercles gouvernementaux semble indiquer que la culture de la corruption du secteur privé est à l'origine de l'état déplorable du Bureau colonial.;Ein sich langsam entfaltender Korruptionsskandal im $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Kolonialamt erschüttert $CAPITAL$.

Kritiker unserer Regierungspolitik weisen auf die relativ geringen Löhne und Budgets von Kolonialoffiziellen als Hauptgründe des Skandals hin, während in Regierungskreisen eher die Meinung vorzuherrschen scheint, dass tiefgreifende Korruption im Privatsektor für den erbärmlichen Zustand des Kolonialamts verantwortlich ist.;;Un escándalo de corrupción desvelado lentamente en la oficina colonial $COUNTRY_ADJ$ sacude $CAPITAL$, cuando un periódico importante publica reportajes detallando una red extensa de sobornos y favores, diseñada para proporcionar a ciertos intereses privados un trato preferencial respecto al comercio y la explotación de las colonias.

Die Unterteilung in Nord und Süden, oft durch die Mason-Dixon-Linie definiert, bezog sich nicht nur auf die Sklaverei, sondern auch auf die Identität.;;¡Ojala estuviera en Dixie, hurra! ¡Hurra!\nEn Dixie Land resistiré para vivir y morir en Dixie,\nLejos, lejos, lejos en el sur, en Dixie.\n\n-- Dixie's Land\n\nSe ha especulado que el nombre 'Dixie', utilizado para referirse a los EE.

EVTDESC16170;Slave Power was a term used to describe the political power of the landed, slave-owning 'aristocrats' of the Southern USA. Many Northern politicians saw slavery first and foremost not as an issue of mistreatment of blacks, but as something profoundly opposed and contrarian to the republican ideals laid out in the founding documents of the United States, and, thus, a threat more to the nation's civic virtues than to anything else. Today the Southern senators blocked a bill in the House of Representatives.

EVTDESC16415;The Ku Klux Klan, abbreviated 'The KKK', was a decentralized organization primarily composed of white southerners, formed in 1865 by Confederate war veterans from Tennessee. A secret vigilante group, known for its iconic symbolism of burning crosses and white hoods and robes, the KKK was formed in opposition to the tenets of Republican Reconstruction, dedicated to preserving white supremacy in the former Confederate states. The Klan shunned few means in accomplishing its goal, and violence directed at southern republicans and blacks was rule rather than exception. The Klan was suppressed by the Federal Government by the passing of the Force Acts of 1871, during the first term of Ulyssess S. Grant.

Pour parvenir à ses fins, le KKK avait recours à la violence, une violence principalement dirigée contre les républicains du Sud et les noirs.

Dem Klan waren zur Erreichung seines Ziels jede Mittel recht, und gegen Republikaner und Schwarze gerichtete Gewalt war eher die Regel als eine Ausnahme.

The two-day $CAPITAL$ Convention has been held, with both men and women attending, but with the first day's proceedings reserved for the ladies, and with the second day devoted almost exclusively to political tactics. Although there was no unanimity between the delegates, the convention has nevertheless decided to adopt ten resolutions which, taken together, demand that women be accorded equality in matters of Family Law, Education, Property Rights, Jobs, Religion, and Morals.;Un petit groupe de femmes a organisé une convention internationale sur le sujet des droits des femmes. Le deux jours de la convention de $CAPITAL$ se sont tenus, avec à la fois des hommes et des femmes, mais avec la première journée réservée aux dames, et avec la deuxième journée des hommes consacrée presque exclusivement à la tactique politique. Bien qu'il n'y ait pas d'unanimité entre les délégués, la convention a néanmoins décidé d'adopter dix résolutions qui, prises ensemble, demandent que les femmes se voient accorder l'égalité en matière de droit familial, d'éducation, les droits de propriété, l'emploi, la religion et la morale. ;Eine kleine Frauengruppe hat eine große Versammlung zum Thema Frauenrechte organisiert. Die Versammlung, an der Männer und Frauen teilnahmen, dauerte zwei Tage. Vorträge und Diskussionen waren am ersten Tag aber ausschließlich Frauen vorbehalten. Am zweiten Tag wurde diskutiert, ob Frauen das Wahlrecht verlangen sollten oder nicht. Die Versammlungsteilnehmer waren zwar nicht hundertprozentig einer Meinung, konnten aber zehn Resolutionen verabschieden. Zusammengefasst wurde darin die Gleichberechtigung der Frauen bezüglich Familie, Ausbildung, Arbeit, Religion und Moral gefordert.;;Un pequeño grupo de mujeres ha organizado una convención internacional sobre el tema de los derechos de la mujer. La convención de dos días en $CAPITAL$, ha contado con la presencia de hombres y mujeres, pero con los actos del primer día reservados a las mujeres, y los del segundo dedicados casi exclusivamente a estrategias políticas. Aunque no hubo unanimidad entre los delegados, la convención ha decidido, sin embargo, adoptar diez resoluciones que, tomadas en su conjunto, exigen que se declare la igualdad de la mujer en asuntos de familia, ley, educación, derechos de propiedad, trabajo, religión y moralidad.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17020;The subject of woman's Suffrage has come into national focus at the $CAPITAL$ Anti-Slavery Convention, held just the other day in $CAPITAL$, $COUNTRY$. With several international delegates present, some of whom women, a motion was put before the convention that female delegates, while they should be heard before the chamber, should ultimately be denied the right to vote on any resolutions to be adopted by the convention. The seating arrangements alone have become an issue, as men and women at the convention sit segregated. It is becoming ever more obvious that women in $COUNTRY$, and the entire Western world, are increasingly striving to partake in public discourse and debate.;La question du droit de vote des femmes s'est invitée à la convention mondiale contre l'esclavage, qui avait eu lieu le jour précédent à $CAPITAL$, en $COUNTRY$. En présence de plusieurs délégués internationaux, parmi lesquels des femmes, une motion a été présentée à la convention pour que les femmes déléguées, alors qu'elles devraient être entendues devant la chambre, devraient finalement se voir refuser le droit de voter sur les résolutions qui seront adoptées par la convention. L'accueil même des participants pose problème, puisque les hommes et les femmes de la convention ne peuvent pas s'asseoir côte à côte. ll apparaît de plus en plus évident que les femmes de $COUNTRY$, et que le monde occidental dans son ensemble, entendent participer au débat public.;Das Thema des Frauenwahlrechts ist bei der $CAPITAL$-Anti-Sklaverei-Konvention, die gestern in $CAPITAL$, $COUNTRY$ abgehalten wurde, in den nationalen Fokus gerückt. In Anwesenheit mehrerer internationaler Delegierter, einige davon Frauen, wurde auf der Konvention ein Antrag vorgelegt, dass weibliche Delegierten das Recht verwehrt werden sollte, über jegliche auf der Konvention getroffene Lösungen abzustimmen, wenngleich sie dort Reden halten durften. Schon alleine die Sitzverteilung auf der Konvention ist zu einem Problem geworden, da Männer und Frauen getrennt sitzen#. Es ist offensichtlicher als je zuvor, dass Frauen in $COUNTRY$ und der gesamten westlichen Welt zunehmend danach streben, an öffentlichen Vorträgen und Debatten teilzunehmen.;;El asunto del sufragismo se ha convertido en problema nacional en la Convención contra la esclavitud de $CAPITAL$, que tuvo lugar el otro día en $CAPITAL$, $COUNTRY$. Con varios delegados internacionales presentes, algunos de ellos mujeres, se presentó una moción ante la convención por la que las delegadas femeninas debían ser oídas ante la cámara pero, en última instancia se les negaría el derecho a votar en las resoluciones que adoptara la convención. Ya solo la disposición de los asientos se ha convertido en un problema, porque los hombres y las mujeres de la convención se sientan separados. Se hace más obvio que nunca que en $COUNTRY$, y en todo el mundo occidental, la mujer cada vez está participando más intensamente en los discursos y debates públicos.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17030;With the war dragging on, and more and more of our able-bodied young men being called up for military service, several leading industrialists have suggested that we tap the productive energies of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ womanhood, and rotate women into temporary employment in the factories. This policy, so say the learned of industry, has already been proven successful in several small-scale attempts, where women have been found to be nowhere near the slow learners that common wisdom had otherwise made them out to be. Apparently, they are quite capable of handling the tasks assigned to them in a factory environment. The age of wonders is not past, it seems.;Alors que la guerre s'éternise et que de plus en plus de jeunes hommes valides sont appelés sous les drapeaux, plusieurs grands industriels ont suggéré de faire appel à la main-d'œuvre féminine $COUNTRY_ADJ$ et de faire tourner ces femmes, dans le cadre d'emplois temporaire, dans les usines. Cette politique, comme le soulignent ces industriels, s'est déjà avérée bénéfique lors de tentatives de moindre envergure, et les femmes, contrairement aux idées reçues, apprennent vite. Apparemment, elles sont tout à fait capables de remplir les tâches qui leur sont confiées dans les usines. L'ère des miracles ne connaît pas de fin, visiblement.;Der Krieg zieht sich in die Länge, und immer mehr unserer jungen Männer müssen an die Front. Mehrere führende Industrialisten haben deshalb vorgeschlagen, dass wir uns die Arbeitskraft der $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Frauen zunutze machen und sie vorübergehend in den Fabriken beschäftigen. Dies hat sich bereits bei mehreren Versuchen auf kleiner Basis bewährt, als sich Frauen ganz und gar nicht als die langsamen Lerner herausgestellt, für die man sie im Allgemeinen hielt. Anscheinend sind sie durchaus in der Lage, die ihnen in einer Fabrik gestellten Aufgaben zu erfüllen. Das Zeitalter der Weltwunder ist anscheinend noch nicht vorbei.;;Como la guerra parece no acabar nunca y cada vez más jóvenes son llamados a cumplir el servicio militar, varios industriales destacados han sugerido que explotemos las energías productivas de las mujeres de $COUNTRY$, y alternemos a las mujeres en empleos temporales en las fábricas. Esta política, según dicen los expertos en política, ya ha demostrado tener éxito en diversos intentos a pequeña escala, en los que las mujeres han demostrado que no son en absoluto las criaturas de aprendizaje torpe que la sabiduría popular decía. Aparentemente, son bastante capaces de asumir las tareas que les sean encomendadas en una fábrica. Parece que aún no ha acabado la era de los descubrimientos maravillosos.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17040;And, it is therefore my conclusion, that although there are certain professions generally unsuitable for women to occupy, their presence in the work place poses no fundamental threat to the social order.'\n\nA well-known and respected member of our military establishment has, today, published an opinion editorial in the $CAPITAL$ Courier, one of $COUNTRY$'s leading dailies. In what has been described as the biggest career blunder in the decade, the general has advocated the inclusion of women in the work place, in factories and businesses, arguing primarily that their inclusion and protection under law would only amount to a confirmation of the already established de facto state of women being employed.;"... et, par conséquent, j'en conclus que, même si certaines professions ne conviennent généralement pas aux femmes, leur présence dans le monde du travail ne constitue en rien une menace pour l'ordre social."\n\nUn membre très connu et respecté de notre effectif militaire a, aujourd'hui, publié un éditorial dans le Courrier de $CAPITAL$, l'un des plus grands quotidiens de $COUNTRY$. Dans cet éditorial, considéré comme la plus grande bévue de la décennie, le général a défendu l'embauche de femmes dans le monde du travail, usines et entreprises confondues, soulignant notamment le fait que leur intégration et leur protection légales ne feraient que confirmer le statut de facto des femmes déjà en poste.;Und demzufolge komme ich zu dem Schluss, dass obwohl manche Berufe für Frauen sicherlich ungeeignet sind, ihre Gegenwart am Arbeitsplatz keine fundamentale Gefährdung der sozialen Ordnung darstellt.'\n\nEin bekanntes und wohl respektiertes Mitglied unseres Militärs hat heute im $CAPITAL$-Kurier, einer der führenden Tageszeitungen in $COUNTRY$, einen Meinungsartikel veröffentlicht. Im wohl größten Karrierefehlgriff des Jahrzehnts hat der General die Einbeziehung von Frauen am Arbeitsplatz in Fabriken und Geschäften befürwortet und dabei hauptsächlich damit argumentiert, ihre Einbeziehung und ihr rechtlicher Schutz wären lediglich eine Bestätigung des bereits etablierten Status von Frauen als Arbeitskräfte.;;Y es mi conclusión que, aunque hay ciertas profesiones que, en general, no son adecuadas para la mujer, su presencia en el mercado laboral no presenta amenaza alguna para el orden social.\n\nUn conocido y respetado miembro de nuestro ejército ha publicado hoy una carta de opinión en el Correo de $CAPITAL$, uno de los principales diarios de $COUNTRY$. En lo que ya se considera como el mayor error en una carrera de la década, el general ha defendido la inserción de la mujer en el trabajo, en las fábricas y los negocios, argumentando que esta inserción y su correspondiente protección legal, solo contribuirían a confirmar la situación ya existente de hecho en el empleo femenino.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17050;The $CAPITAL$ weather did its worst against us: mud, mud, mud, was its prominent feature, and it was known among us afterwards as the mud march.'\n\nA female suffragette commented the elements during the Mud March, a demonstration march which, just this past week, attracted over 3,000 women from various organizations, female textile workers, temperance advocates, artists and many other, all coming together in a show of force for Woman's Liberation and Suffrage, on $CAPITAL$'s streets. A gay enough procession by most accounts, despite the weather.;Les conditions météorologiques de $CAPITAL$ n'ont pas joué en notre faveur. Il y avait de la boue partout et c'est la raison pour laquelle la manifestation a été plus tard appelée la "Mud March".\n\nUne suffragette a commenté la Mud March, une manifestation qui, la semaine dernière, a réuni plus de 3000 femmes de différentes organisations, des ouvrières du textile, des modérées, des artistes, etc., toutes venues défendre la libération de la femme et le droit de vote dans les rues de $CAPITAL$. Une manifestation bon enfant, malgré le mauvais temps.;Das $CAPITAL$-Wetter hat uns einen Bärendienst erwiesen: Schlamm, Schlamm und nochmal Schlamm ... später wurde die Aktion als Schlamm-Marsch bezeichnet.'\n\n Mit diesen Worten kommentierte eine Frauenrechtlerin den Schlamm-Marsch, einen Demonstrationszug, an dem über sich 3000 Frauen verschiedener Organisationen, Textilarbeiterinnen, Abstinenzbefürworter, Künstler und viele anderen beteiligten. Man zeigte auf den Straßen von $CAPITAL$ zusammen Präsenz für die Befreiung der Frauen und ihr Wahlrecht. Trotz des Wetters ein knallbunter Demonstrationszug.;;El tiempo de $CAPITAL$ se confabuló contra nosotras. Barro, barro y más barro. Esa fue la característica principal que hizo que entre nosotras la denominásemos como la Marcha del Barro.\n\nEste fue el comentario de una sufragista acerca de los elementos climatológicos durante la Marcha del Barro, una manifestación celebrada la pasada semana que atrajo a unas 3.000 mujeres de diversas organizaciones, trabajadoras textiles, defensores del movimiento antialcohólico, artistas y muchos otros, unidos para una demostración de fuerza en pos de la liberación y el sufragio de la mujer en las calles de $CAPITAL$. Un orgulloso desfile según los testigos, a pesar del tiempo.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17060;Suffragettes, picketing a local bar in one of our provinces, are becoming the laughing stock of the entire state. The sight of the two, relatively frail, upper class women, standing with their placards outside the bar, picketing for Woman's Suffrage and temperance, is not only being made into an object of ridicule, it is also causing some anger among the lower classes, who feel that the well-offs, the high-and-mighties and the holier-than-thous are trying to patronize (or matronize, as the case may be) them with sophistry and rhetoric.;Les suffragettes, en piquet de grève dans un bar local d'une de nos provinces, sont la risée de tout l'État. La vue de deux femmes, relativement frêles et issues des classes supérieures, arborant leurs pancartes pour le droit de vote des femmes et la modération à l'extérieur du bar, en plus d'être ridicule, suscite la colère des classes inférieures qui estiment que ces nanties tentent là de les patronner à grand renfort de sophistique et de rhétorique.;Frauenrechtlerinnen, die eine lokale Bar in einer unserer Provinzen bestreiken, haben sich im ganzen Staat zur Lachnummer gemacht. Der Auftritt zweier zierlicher Frauen, die mit ihren Plakaten vor der Bar stehen und für Frauenwahlrecht und Mäßigung demonstrieren, wird nicht nur öffentlich verspottet, sondern sorgt auch in der Unterschicht für einigen Ärger. Deren Angehörige finden, dass die Besserverdienenden und selbstgefälligen Mächtigen versuchen, sie von oben herab mit Spitzfindigkeit und Rhetorik zu belehren.;;Las sufragistas, que han organizado un piquete en un bar local de una de nuestras provincias, se han convertido en el hazmerreír de todo el estado. La visión de dos frágiles mujeres de clase alta, situadas fuera del bar con sus pancartas, haciendo un piquete por el sufragio femenino y el movimiento antialcohólico, no solo se ha convertido en objeto de burlas, sin que también está generando malestar entre las clases bajas, que sienten que la gente de buena cuna, los altos y poderosos y las personas de bien se comportan con ellos de forma paternalista (o mejor dicho en este caso, maternalista) de una forma sutil y retórica.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17070;Like many nascent political ideologies, the early suffragette movements were not foreign to in-fighting and organizational splits over issues of tactics and perceived ideological differences, the split between the NUWSS and the NSWRV in Britain being a poignant example. The suffragette movement in $COUNTRY$ is experiencing somewhat of a setback, on account of an organizational split. ;Comme bon nombre d'idéologies naissantes, les premiers mouvements des suffragettes n'échappaient pas aux divergences tactiques et différences idéologiques, comme en témoigne le poignant exemple de la scission entre le NUWSS et le NSWRV en Grande-Bretagne. Le mouvement des suffragettes de $COUNTRY$ essuie un revers dû à une scission organisationnelle. ;Wie bei vielen aufkeimenden politischen Ideologien war es den frühen Suffragettenbewegungen nicht fremd, untereinander zu streiten und sich über Taktikfragen und vermeintlich ideologische Differenzen aufzuspalten. Die Aufspaltung zwischen der NUWSS und NSWRV in England ist dafür ein Musterbeispiel. Die Frauenrechtsbewegung in $COUNTRY$ ist aufgrund einer organisatorischen Aufspaltung einen Rückschlag erlitten.;;Como muchas ideologías políticas emergentes, los primeros movimientos sufragistas no eran ajenos a las luchas internas y a las escisiones organizativas en lo referente a tácticas y percepción de las cuestiones ideológicas.

El movimiento sufragista en $COUNTRY$ está experimentando una cierta regresión debida a una división organizativa. ;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC17150;The (so-called) Cat and Mouse Act was an infamous British law passed in 1912 in order to combat the suffragette tactic of using hunger strikes as a means to build sympathy for the Suffragette cause. The law stated that a person could be released from jail to recover from any serious illness, only to be jailed again on recovery, thereby washing the government's hands of any harm caused to the woman in question by the hunger strike. A similar ordinance has found its way into the legislature of one of our states, where suffragette hunger strikes are handled in this exact same way.;La loi du chat et de la souris était une loi britannique impopulaire visant à contrecarrer la tactique des suffragettes qui avaient recours aux grèves de la faim pour rallier du soutien à leur cause. Cette loi stipulait qu'une personne pouvait être libérée de prison, pour se faire soigner, en cas de maladie grave et qu'une fois rétablie, elle était réemprisonnée et ce, pour permettre au gouvernement de se laver les mains de tout mauvais traitement infligé aux suffragettes. Une loi est en cours dans l'un de nos États pour assurer un traitement similaire aux grèves de la faim entreprises par les suffragettes.;Das (so genannte) Katz- und Mausgesetz war ein berüchtigtes britisches Gesetz, das im Jahr 1912 verabschiedet wurde, um der Hungerstreiktaktik zum Erheischen von Sympathie der Frauenrechtlerinnen entgegen zu wirken. Das Gesetz besagte, dass eine Person aus dem Gefängnis entlassen werden konnte, um sich von einer schweren Krankheit zu erholen ... nur um die Haft nach der Erholung fortzusetzen. Damit sprach sich die Regierung von aller Verantwortung für etwaige gesundheitlichen Schäden frei, die sich die fragliche Frau durch den Hungerstreik zuziehen konnte. Eine vergleichbare Verordnung hat sich in der Legislative einer unserer Staaten verankert, wo mit Hungerstreiks von Frauenrechtlerinnen auf exakt dieselbe Weise umgegangen wird.;;La así llamada 'Cat and Mouse Act' (acta del gato y el ratón) fue una infame ley británica promulgada en 1912 para contrarrestar la táctica de las sufragistas de iniciar huelgas de hambre a fin de conseguir simpatizantes para su causa.

He visto las pancartas rojas en las calles de $CAPITAL$, y creo que la única manera de combatir la creciente ola de socialismo es a través de una política de adaptación.\n\nEn la cámara alta, un grupo de liberales de mentalidad reformista ha decidido probar suerte con la agenda socialista en lo referente a la reforma sindical. El grupo, aduciendo que nuestras actuales políticas apenas permiten influencia de la opinión pública, y proponiendo que es necesaria una reforma laboral para proteger los intereses de los trabajadores, se está organizando para formar un bloque parlamentario. ¿Deberíamos mover algunos hilos en el parlamento para contrarrestar este movimiento?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18050;... so it is now, with renewed force, that I restate that conundrum of mine which is yet to garner any sort of response from this chamber: What is to be done about the issue of the press reform? Me, and many colleagues with me, have long argued that the time for reform is now, yet this session has remained entirely unwilling to commit to even an answer, much less a policy.'\n\nReform-minded MPs in parliament have reformed in a new coalition to push the agenda for press reform. Capitalizing on popular sentiment for freedom of expression, the liberals are gaining strength in the Upper House.;... et c'est donc maintenant, avec une force renouvelée, que je reformule ce dilemme qui est le mien et qui est, pourtant, de recueillir toute sorte de réponse de cette chambre : qu'est-ce qui doit être fait à propos le question de la la réforme la presse ?

Capitalisant sur le sentiment populaire pour la liberté d'expression, les libéraux gagnent du terrain à la Chambre haute. ;... und so bringe ich nun vor diesem Haus zum wiederholten Male die schwierige Frage auf, die immer noch irgendeiner Art von Reaktion ausharrt: Was soll hinsichtlich der Pressereform getan werden? Ich und viele meiner Kollegen sagen schon seit langer Zeit, dass jetzt die Zeit für Reformen gekommen ist, und dennoch ist diese Versammlung seit jeher vollkommen unwillig, eine Antwort zu geben, geschweige denn eine Gesetzesänderung zu veranlassen.'\n\nReformwillige Parlamentsabgeordnete haben eine Koalition gebildet, um die Pressereform-Agenda voranzubringen. Die Liberalen schlagen dabei Nutzen aus der öffentlichen Meinung zugunsten der freien Meinungsäußerung und stärken ihre Position im Oberhaus.;;... así que ahora, con fuerza renovada, es cuando yo repito aquel enigma mío que aún espera algún tipo de respuesta de esta cámara: ¿Qué se va a hacer con el asunto de la reforma de prensa? Yo, y mis compañeros conmigo, ya hemos abogado de sobras que el momento de la reforma es ahora, pero esta audiencia se ha mostrado totalmente reacia a ofrecer siquiera una respuesta, y mucho menos una política de acción.\n\nLos parlamentarios reformistas se han transformado en nueva coalición para presionar la agenda de la reforma de prensa. Capitalizando el sentimiento popular sobre la libertad de expresión, los liberales están ganado fuerza en la cámara alta.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18060;Which is why we have only a resounding 'No' to offer the propositions of further reforms! We came here with a platform of limited reform, but we now hear talk of reforms that threaten to overthrow every sacred and long established institution of this land, ultimately threatening to unravel the very fabric of our society.'\n\nDisgruntled by the prevailing political winds, an unholy alliance between members of several factions in the Upper House have coalesced into one block dedicated to opposing all further efforts at fundamentally reforming the political system.;… et c'est pourquoi nous avons seulement un «non» retentissant à offrir aux propositions de nouvelles réformes ! Nous sommes venus ici avec une base de réforme limitée, mais nous devons maintenant entendre parler de réformes qui menacent de renverser toutes les institutions sacrées et établies de longue date de cette terre, et en fin de compte menaçant de défaire le tissu même de notre société. \n\nContrarié par les les vents politiques dominants, une alliance contre nature entre les membres de plusieurs factions de la Chambre haute a fusionné en un seul groupe dédié à s'opposer à tous les nouveaux efforts de réforme fondamentale du système politique. ;Und aus diesem Grund haben wir die Forderungen nach weiteren Reformen entschieden abgelehnt! Wir haben uns hier auf der Basis beschränkter Reformen getroffen, nun aber werden Stimmen laut, die Reformen fordern, die jede heilige und seit langer Zeit bestehende Institution dieses Landes umstürzen und letztendlich das Gefüge unserer Gesellschaft aus den Angeln heben würden.'\n\nAufgrund ihrer Verärgerung über die derzeitige politische Situation sind mehrere Mitglieder verschiedener Fraktion des Oberhaus eine Allianz des Bösen eingegangen. Sie haben einen eigenen Block gebildet und wollen alle zukünftigen Versuche verhindern, das politische System grundlegend zu reformieren.;;¡Es por eso que solo podemos responder con un 'No' rotundo a las propuestas de más reformas! Nosotros vinimos con un programa de reformas limitado, pero ahora oímos hablar de reformas que amenazan con acabar con cualquier institución sagrada y sobradamente establecida de este territorio, amenazando en última instancia con desmadejar el mismísimo tejido de nuestra sociedad.\n\nDisgustados por los vientos políticos predominantes, en la cámara alta se ha formado una truculenta alianza entre miembros de diversas facciones conformando un solo bloque dedicado a oponerse a cualquier tentativa que signifique en la práctica una reforma del sistema político.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18070;...anyone opposed?'\n\nDuring a hastily called extraordinary session of the Upper House, a curious motion for constitutional reform has been passed.

La réforme propose un système avec une partie nommée par la Chambre haute, et le mouvement a toutes les caractéristiques d'un putsch par le parti réactionnaire déjà dominant. ;... Gegenstimmen?'\n\nWährend einer außerordentlichen Sitzung des Oberhauses wurde einem merkwürdigen Antrag zur Verfassungsreform stattgegeben. Der Antrag schlägt ein politisches System mit einem Oberhaus vor, dessen Abgeordnete von der Regierungspartei ernannt werden. Dies wirkt wie ein Putschversuch der reaktionären Regierungspartei.;;... ¿alguien en contra?\n\nDurante una sesión extraordinaria de la cámara alta, convocada a toda prisa, se ha aprobado una curiosa moción para la reforma constitucional. La reforma propone un sistema con un partido adscrito a la cámara alta, y el movimiento tiene todos los visos de un golpe de estado por parte del partido reaccionario que ya gobierna.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18080;A debate on wage slavery has taken hold in the Upper House, and the socialist party is gaining traction by arguing the need for wage reform. The broad popular support for further social reforms has lead to several nominally non-socialist members of the house finding themselves increasingly pressed by their home constituencies to push for further reforms, causing some of them to consider crossing the aisle over to the socialist block. Through political maneuvering, we could probably avoid massive defections to the socialists, but this would probably be seen as an autocratic move by broad stratas of our country's population.;Un débat sur l'esclavage salarié s'est amorcé à la Chambre haute, et le parti socialiste gagne du terrain en faisant valoir la nécessité d'une réforme des salaires. Le large soutien populaire à la poursuite des réformes sociales a conduit plusieurs membres, théoriquement non-socialistes de la Chambre se trouvant de plus en plus pressés par leur circonscription, d'aller dans le sens de la poursuite des réformes, ce qui amène certains d'entre-eux à envisager de traverser l'allée pour rejoindre le banc socialiste. Grâce à des manœuvres politiques, nous pourrions sans doute éviter des défections massives pour les socialistes, mais ce serait probablement considéré comme un geste autocratique par de larges franges de la population de notre pays. ;Eine Debatte über Lohnsklaverei hat das Oberhaus erfasst, und die sozialistische Partei gewinnt mit ihrer Befürwortung einer dringend erforderlichen Lohnreform an Boden. Die breite Unterstützung der Öffentlichkeit für weitere Sozialreformen hat dazu geführt, dass sich mehrere nominell nicht-sozialistische Abgeordnete von ihren Heimatwahlkreisen zunehmend unter Druck gesetzt sehen, weitere Reformen voranzutreiben. Dies hat dazu geführt, dass einige von ihnen sich überlegen, eventuell in den sozialistischen Block zu wechseln. Mit Hilfe politischer Manöver könnten wir wahrscheinlich einen massiven Überlauf zu den Sozialisten vermeiden, aber dies würde von der Bevölkerung unseres Landes wahrscheinlich als autokratische Aktion gewertet werden.;;Un debate sobre el salario mínimo ha tenido lugar en la cámara alta, y el partido socialista está ganando fuerza con el argumento de la necesidad de una reforma salarial. El amplio apoyo popular a más reformas sociales ha llevado a varios miembros de la casa que en teoría no son socialistas a verse cada vez más presionados por sus electorados locales para que impulsen más reformas, dando lugar a que algunos de ellos consideren cruzar el pasillo hacia el bloque socialista. Por medio de maniobras políticas, probablemente, podríamos evitar deserciones masivas hacia el bando socialista, pero seguramente sería visto por amplios segmentos de la población del país como un movimiento despótico.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18090;The Liberal caucus has convened to further press the agenda for political reform. Citing concerns about alleged infringements of the state apparatus into the private lives of citizens, and a political system firmly lodged in the hands of the few at the expense of the many, the liberals have threatened to block all bills from passing the Upper House until their concerns have been addressed. A few members of other parties are considering aligning themselves with the liberals on the issues of political reform, and any delay on our part will most likely serve to further increase popular frustration over the slow pace of reform.;Le caucus libéral est convoqué pour continuer l'ordre du jour de la réforme politique. Citant des préoccupations au sujet d'interventions alléguées de l'appareil étatique dans la vie privée des citoyens, et un système politique fermement ancrée dans les mains de quelques-uns au détriment de la majorité, les libéraux ont menacé de bloquer tous les projets de loi de passage à la Chambre haute jusqu'à ce que leurs préoccupations aient été abordées. Quelques membres des autres parties envisagent de s'aligner avec les libéraux sur les questions de réforme politique, et tout retard de notre part, très probablement, servira à augmenter encore la frustration populaire face à la lenteur de la réforme. ;Das liberale Gremium wurde einberufen, um die Agenda für politische Formen voranzutreiben. Die Liberalen berufen sich auf die angebliche Einmischung des Staats in das Privatleben der Bürger und ein politisches System, dass auf Kosten vieler fest in den Händen weniger liegt und drohen deshalb damit, sämtliche Gesetzentwürfe im Oberhaus zu blockieren, bis man sich um ihre Anliegen gekümmert hat. Einige wenige Mitglieder anderer Parteien ziehen in Betracht, sich bezüglich politischer Reformen auf die Seite der Liberalen zu schlagen, und jedwede Verzögerung unsererseits würde wahrscheinlich den Frust der Bevölkerung über das langsame Voranschreiten der Reformpläne noch weiter steigern.;;La asamblea liberal ha acordado hacer más presión sobre la agenda para la reforma política. Mencionando sus inquietudes por la supuesta injerencia del aparato del estado en la vida privada de los ciudadanos, y por un sistema político firmemente aposentado en las manos de unos pocos a costa de la mayoría, los liberales han amenazado con bloquear cualquier presupuesto en la cámara alta hasta que sus preocupaciones hayan sido abordadas. Algunos miembros de otros partidos están considerando la posibilidad de unirse a los liberales en lo tocante a asuntos de reforma política, y cualquier demora por nuestra parte dará lugar con toda probabilidad, a un mayor incremento de la frustración popular por el lento avance de la reforma.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18100;...it seems to me, therefore, a defect in our much lauded system that the lowliest workers can not even afford for themselves and their next of kin the bare minimums of sanitary living. The grimy, soot-ridden hovels, huddling under the shadows of the soot-stacks springing up like mushrooms after a rain storm, are damp and dark breeding grounds for flue, tuberculosis and immorality. A limited health reform, dear colleagues, would go far in amending these problems.'\n\nThe Upper House is in turmoil over it's apparent inability to pass social reform, despite mounting public demands.;... c'est il me semble, par conséquent, un défaut dans notre système tant vanté que les plus humbles des travailleurs ne peuvent même pas, pour eux-mêmes et leurs plus proches parents, avoir le minimum de la vie hygiénique. Les crasseux taudis de suie montés à la hâte poussent comme des champignons après la pluie, sont humides et sombres et sont des lieux de reproduction idéaux pour le choléra, la tuberculose et l'immoralité. Une réforme limitée de la santé, mes chers collègues, irait déjà loin pour s'attaquer à ces problèmes. \n\nLa Chambre haute est dans la tourmente sur son incapacité apparente à passer la réforme sociale, en dépit du support publique. ;... und deshalb erscheint es mir ein Fehler unseres viel gelobten System zu sein, dass sich wenig verdienende Arbeiter nicht einmal das absolute Minimum hygienischer Lebensbedingungen leisten können. Die schmutzigen, rußverschmierten Hütten im Schatten der Fabriken sprießen aus dem Boden wie Pilze nach dem Regen. Sie sind klamm und dunkel, was Cholera, Tuberkulose und anderen Krankheiten ideale Ausbreitungsbedingungen bietet. Meine verehrten Kollegen, eine beschränkte Gesundheitsreform könnte diesen Problemen deutlich entgegenwirken.'\n\nDas Oberhaus ist aufgrund seiner offensichtlichen Unfähigkeit zur Verabschiedung einer Sozialreform trotz stärker werdender Forderungen der Öffentlichkeit total aus dem Gleichgewicht geraden.;;... a mí me parece, por lo tanto, un defecto en nuestro tan aclamado sistema que los trabajadores más humildes no puedan costearse los mínimos más elementales de atención sanitaria para ellos y sus familias. Los chamizos mugrientos que se amontonan a la sombra de los montones de hollín, brotando como hongos después de la tormenta, son criaderos húmedos y oscuros de cólera, tuberculosis e inmoralidad.

EVTDESC18110;I believe it possible that an agreement can be concluded.'\n\nA temporary Upper House Majority has formed on the issue of Unemployment Subsidies. Speaking in parliament, the conservative group leader has opined that he believes that the measures can be enacted, as an experiment with national policy, if nothing else. Citing fears of public discontent with the present plight of the unemployed, his group will back a proposal for modest unemployment benefits. Liberals in parliament remain wholly unconvinced of the proposition, but not enacting the proposal will be seen as a lost opportunity by those pushing for reform.;Je crois que c'est possible qu'un accord puisse être conclu. \n\nUne temporaire majorité à la Chambre haute s'est formée sur la question des allocations de chômage. Prenant la parole au parlement, le chef de file du groupe conservateur a exprimé l'avis qu'il estime que les mesures peuvent être adoptées, comme une expérimentation pour la politique nationale, et rien d'autre. Citant les craintes de mécontentement de la population face à la situation actuelle du chômage, son groupe soutiendra une proposition de modestes prestations de chômage. Les libéraux au Parlement restent entièrement convaincus de cette proposition, mais ne pas adopter la proposition sera considérée comme une occasion perdue par ceux qui poussent à la réforme. ;Ich glaube, dass wir zu einer Vereinbarung kommen können.'\n\nDie Einführung der Arbeitslosenunterstützung wird von einer Oberhausmehrheit unterstützt. Der Sprecher der konservativen Gruppe trug im Parlament vor, dass man die Maßnahmen zumindest versuchsweise in Kraft zu setzen. Die Gruppe begründet ihre Unterstützung einer einfachen Arbeitslosenunterstützung mit der Furcht vor wachsendem öffentlichen Unmut wegen der fortwährend hohen Arbeitslosigkeit. Die Liberalen im Parlament sind von dem Vorschlag weiterhin alles andere als überzeugt, aber die Nichtverabschiedung dieser Gesetzesvorlage würde von den Reformbefürwortern als verpasste Gelegenheit angesehen werden.;;Creo posible que se pueda llegar a un acuerdo.\n\nSe ha formado una mayoría parlamentaria temporal en la cámara alta en lo tocante a los subsidios de desempleo. Hablando en el parlamento, el líder del grupo conservador ha mantenido la opinión de que cree que las medidas pueden llevarse a cabo, como experimento de política nacional, cuando menos. Mencionando los temores de descontento público con la penosa situación actual de los desempleados, su grupo respaldará una propuesta para módicas prestaciones de desempleo. Los liberales del parlamento siguen sin estar del todo convencidos con la propuesta, pero no sacar a delante la propuesta se vería como una oportunidad perdida por aquellos que abogan por la reforma.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18120;I believe therefore that the only natural solution to the present polylemma is to argue in favor of my conservative colleagues on these issues.'\n\nThe strong popular support, combined with rising militancy, for a conservative national policy has led to friction in the Upper House. Several liberal members of parliament are considering defection to the conservative faction, and only ham-handed use of the party whip could possibly keep the liberals in their places.;Je crois donc que la seule solution naturelle à la présente polylemma (multiples dilemmes), est de plaider en faveur de mes collègues conservateurs sur ces questions. \n\nLe fort soutien populaire, combiné à la hausse du militantisme pour une politique conservatrice nationale, a conduit à des frictions à la Chambre haute. Plusieurs députés libéraux envisagent de faire défection à la faction conservatrice, et seulement l'utilisation maladroite du parti whip pourrait peut-être garder les libéraux à leur place. ;Ich glaube deshalb, dass die einzige natürliche Lösung des momentanen Dilemmas die Abstimmung zugunsten des Standpunkts meiner konservativen Kollegen ist.'\n\nDie starke Unterstützung der Öffentlichkeit einer konservativen Nationalpolitik hat zusammen mit der steigenden Militanz zu Spannungen im Oberhaus geführt. Mehrere liberale Parlamentsabgeordnete spielen mit dem Gedanken, sich der konservativen Fraktion anzuschließen, und nur der entschlossene Einsatz der Partei-Peitsche könnte die Liberalen in die Schranken weisen.;;Por lo tanto, creo que la única solución natural al actual dilema múltiple es decantarme en favor de mis colegas conservadores en tales asuntos.\n\nEl firme apoyo popular, combinado con una militancia en auge, a una política nacional conservadora ha dado lugar a fricciones en la cámara alta.

EVTDESC18140;The Falange is asserting its power both on the streets and in the upper house.

A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the arrest of a wealthy but criminal industrialist has served not to outrage the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, but rather to reinforce their ideals. Today our people walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18506;Ours is a nation of liberty, where every man is born with the inherent right to seek his own destiny. The possibility of prosperity lies within every man's reach. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the acquittal of a man popularly believed to be innocent has served to reinforce our peoples' ideals. Today they walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC18507;It has been often said that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are accustomed to freedom-- they strive for it, hold it as the greatest of ideals. So it is that they chafe under the yoke of what they see as the government's tyranny. A recent demonstration in one of our cities threatens to spread throughout the state. With the eyes of the world upon us, however, forcefully putting an end to this act of civil disobedience will no doubt be seen as an attack upon our own citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18510;Our nation may be broken, but our army is not. In their eyes as they parade through the streets can be seen nothing but utmost devotion to $COUNTRYNAME$, and the ideals for which our nation stands. These men, and the description fits them, have been fostered since childhood into rigid and firm belief in our nation, and they would die to defend it. Long live $COUNTRYNAME$!;Notre nation peut être à genoux, mais notre armée ne l'est pas. Dans leurs yeux quand ils défilent dans les rues on ne voit rien, sauf la plus grande dévotion pour $COUNTRYNAME$, et les idéaux pour lesquels notre pays se bat. Ces hommes, et la description leur convient, ont été encouragés depuis l'enfance dans la rigide et ferme croyance en notre nation, et qu'ils mourraient pour la défendre. Vive $COUNTRYNAME$ ! ;Unsere Nation mag gebrochen sein, unsere Armee ist es nicht. Als sie durch die Straßen marschieren, kann man in ihren Augen nichts als äußerste Hingabe für $COUNTRYNAME$ und die Ideale sehen, für die unsere Nation steht. Diese wackeren Männer wurden seit ihrer Kindheit im unerschütterlichen Glauben an unsere Nation erzogen, und sie sind gewillt, für ihre Verteidigung zu sterben. Lang lebe $COUNTRYNAME$!;;Nuestra nación puede estar fracturada, pero nuestro ejército no. Mientras desfilaba por las calles, en sus ojos no se veía otra cosa que la mayor devoción por $COUNTRYNAME$, y los ideales sobre los que se apoya nuestra nación.

EVTDESC18511;Ours is a nation of might, where a man's strength determines his success and everyone knows very well how superior we are to our neighbours. None can hope to compare to $COUNTRY$ on our best day. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the execution of a foreigner believed to have been engaged in criminal activities on $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soil has served to reinforce our peoples' beliefs. Today they walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC18515;Matters in $COUNTRY$ are getting out of hand. Acts of violence are becoming more commonplace, and some claim that revolution is in the air. Many citizens in $CAPITAL$ are calling on the government to take stronger measures. Sending our army to deal with the violence will, however, only bring the attention of the world upon us. Perhaps this is a time to prove that $COUNTRY$ can deal with its affairs in the way we always have-- with civility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18517;Ours is a nation of order, where peace and civility rule the day. Everyone strives for the common good, and for the progress of our nation as a whole. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the arrest of a prominent criminal figure who had previously eluded authorities has not outraged the people, but rather has served to reinforce their beliefs. Today the people of $COUNTRY$ walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18520;As the soldiers depart from lodgings and barracks to go off, as young men are want to do, to fight and bleed in the great war, their closed marching columns are saluted on their ways by women and children of all ages, standing along roadsides and on railway stations, sending them off with kisses and smiles, and decorating their weapons with flowers.;Alors que les soldats sortent des hébergements et des casernes pour se mettre en route, que les jeunes hommes sont volontaires, pour se battre et saigner dans la grande guerre, leurs colonnes en marche fermée sont saluées sur le passage par des femmes et des enfants de tous âges, debout le long des routes et dans les gares, leur adressant des baisers et des sourires, et décorant leurs armes avec des fleurs. ;Als die Soldaten mit dem Übermut junger Männer aus ihren Unterkünften und Kasernen aufbrechen, um im Krieg zu kämpfen und zu bluten, werden ihre dichten Marschkolonnen auf den Straßen von Frauen und Kinder aller Altersstufen gegrüßt. Auf den Bahnhöfen schmücken sie ihre Waffen mit Blumen und werfen ihnen zum Abschied Küsse zu.;;Mientras los soldados salen de los albergues y los barracones para ir, como todo hombre joven quiere hacer, a combatir y morir en la gran guerra, sus prietas filas son saludadas a su paso por mujeres y niños de todas las edades, que se reúnen a lo largo de las carreteras y en las estaciones de tren, enviándoles besos y sonrisas, y decorando sus armas con flores.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18521;A celebration in $CAPITAL$ took place this month, a sombre affair following the death of a prominent politician.

EVTDESC18540;While some of our policies in the past have been viewed as land-grabbing expansionist imperialism, some people, even abroad, are now arguing that we are simply furthering the cause of human liberty by expanding our nation. A foreign friendship association has recently sent us a telegram of warm congratulations on our latest victories. What is the future course of our nation?;Alors que certaines de nos politiques par le passé ont été perçues comme impérialistes, expansionnistes et spoliatrices de terres, des personnes, même à l'étranger, affirment aujourd'hui que nous sommes tout simplement en train de faire avancer la cause de la liberté humaine par l'expansion de notre nation. Une association d'amitié étrangère nous a récemment envoyé un télégramme de chaleureuses félicitations pour nos dernières victoires. Quel est l'avenir de notre nation ? ;Obwohl unsere Politik der Vergangenheit teilweise als aggressiver, expansionistischer Imperialismus bezeichnet wurde, sind nun einige Leute, selbst im Ausland, der Ansicht, dass wir durch die Expansion unserer Nation lediglich die Sache der menschlichen Freiheit vorantreiben.

EVTDESC18550;As militancy rises in $COUNTRY$, demonstrators take to the streets in $CAPITAL$ to protest the government's policies, calling out for political and economical reform. By dispatching additional police forces to control the situation we can prevent further escalations of violence, but then again, it has always been our nation's tradition that people have the right to make their voices heard. By reaffirming our traditional values, we will look strong in the eyes of the world.;Comme se lève le militantisme en $COUNTRY$, des manifestants descendent dans la rue en $CAPITAL$ pour protester contre la politique du gouvernement, appelant à des réformes politiques et économiques. En envoyant des forces de police supplémentaires pour contrôler la situation, nous pouvons éviter les escalades de violence, mais là encore, cela a toujours été la tradition dans notre pays que les gens aient le droit de faire entendre leur voix. En réaffirmant nos valeurs traditionnelles, nous allons être regardés fortement aux yeux du monde. ;Das Militär in $COUNTRY$ putscht und auf den Straßen von $CAPITAL$ demonstriert das Volk gegen die Regierungspolitik und fordert politische und wirtschaftliche Reformen. Durch den Einsatz zusätzlicher Polizeitruppen zur Kontrolle der Situation können wir die weitere Eskalation der Gewalt verhindern, aber andererseits war es in unserer Nation schon immer Tradition, dass das Volk das Recht hat, seinen Unmut zu äußern. Durch die erneute Bestätigung unser traditionellen Werte werden wir in den Augen der Welt stark erscheinen.;;Mientras crece la militancia en $COUNTRY$, los manifestantes toman las calles de $CAPITAL$ para protestar contar las políticas del gobierno, exigiendo reformas políticas y sociales. Desplegando más fuerzas policiales podemos controlar la situación y evitar una mayor escalada de violencia, pero, por otra parte, siempre ha sido tradición de nuestra nación que la gente tenga derecho a hacer oír su voz. Reafirmando nuestros valores tradicionales, pareceremos fuertes a los ojos del mundo.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18551;Our people have held to our traditions for a very long time. After many years of exposure to the western nations, however, a growing movement has begun to change the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life. Intellectuals in $CAPITAL$ say the government should lead the people into an era of progress and not remain mired in our backward ways. Shall we throw these fools into prison, or consider what they have to say?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18555;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ intellectuals have clashed with members of the aristocracy in $CAPITAL$. The aristocracy has accused the intellectual elite of attempting to cast aside the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life, while the intellectuals say that progress is necessary if $COUNTRY$ is to have any chance against western imperialist powers. The argument of the intellectuals is convincing, but this has not calmed matters in the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18556;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ intellectuals have brought several new ideas before the court, ideas that could advance our research considerably.

EVTDESC18560;A moment ago, they marched and shouted, cries of desperation and anger echoing through the streets. Now, a calm settles over the scene, as the anger subsides into stillness, and strife dissolves into peace. Whatever else can be said about the ails of our country, for all it's flaws and warts and barely overgrown scabs on old wounds, all people in our nation take an equal share in the toils and hardships, and people know this.;Il y a un moment encore, ils marchaient en criant, des cris de désespoir et de colère en écho à travers les rues. Maintenant, le calme s'installe sur la scène, car la colère s'apaise en silence, et dissout les troubles dans la paix. Quelle que soit ce qui peut être dit au sujet des maux de notre pays, pour tous, ces défauts et ces verrues sont à peine recouverts de croûtes sur les anciennes plaies. Toutes les personnes de notre pays doivent prendre une part égale en fatigue et en privation, et les gens le savent bien. ;Vor einem Moment sind sie noch marschiert und verzweifelte und wütende Schreie hallten durch die Straßen. Nun beruhigt sich die Lage ... Stille folgt auf Wut, Frieden auf Zwietracht. Man kann über die Maläsen unseres Landes sagen, was man will: Trotz aller seiner Makel, Warzen und kaum verheilten Wunden ertragen alle Menschen unserer Nation die Mühsal gemeinsam.;;Hace poco, desfilaban y gritaban. Gritos de desesperación e indignación resonaban por las calles. Ahora, reina la tranquilidad, pues la furia se hunde poco a poco en la quietud, y la contienda se disuelve en la paz. Por mucho que se pueda decir de nuestro país, por todas las imperfecciones, los defectos y las costras recientes que cubren las viejas heridas, todo el mundo en nuestra nación comparte a partes iguales el esfuerzo y las penurias, y eso la gente lo sabe.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18561;A great celebration has been held in $CAPITAL$ in honor of $COUNTRY$'s rulers, as well as its centuries of honorable tradition. Massive crowds appeared to cheer on our soldiers, and the spectacle has even drawn the attention of foreigners. Shall we dedicate the celebration to $COUNTRY$'s greatness, or shall we instead use it as an excuse to appease the masses?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18562;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ reactionaries have begun heated debates in one of our states, arguing that $COUNTRY$ should not be slavishly seeking to chase after 'civilized' nations-- indeed, that already $COUNTRY$ has gone too far down the path of degradation and that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people suffer for it. They are calling on the government to repeal reforms, or at the very least to slow down the rapid pace of change... and they are gaining a wide audience.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18565;$COUNTRY$ is a nation of progress, and our current period of insulation against the western powers runs contrary to that ideal. Shall we call on the borders to be opened once again?

EVTDESC18570;They sweat and bleed, they toil and strive, always forward, furthering our nation's pride and prestige. The men and women of our nation are of a fine pedigree, and the feeling they all share, of being part of a common communion, and of sharing the same destiny, gives them the sense that the extra effort they put in is always rewarded. Our egalitarian values have caused the people of our nation to put in an extra effort this year. What should we have them do?;Ils transpirent et saignent, ils travaillent dur et s'efforcent, toujours de l'avant, pour promouvoir la fierté de notre nation et son prestige. Les hommes et les femmes de notre pays sont d'un très bon pedigree, et le sentiment qu'ils partagent tous, de faire partie d'une communauté, et de partager le même destin, leur donne le sentiment que l'effort supplémentaire qu'ils font, est toujours récompensé.

Die Männer und Frauen unserer Nation entstammen einer edlen Rasse, und das Gefühl, zu einer Gemeinschaft zu gehören und dasselbe Schicksal zu teilen, gibt ihnen das Gefühl, dass all ihre zusätzlichen Anstrengungen stets belohnt werden. Unsere egalitären Werte haben unsere Bevölkerung dazu bewegt, sich dieses Jahr besonders anzustrengen. Welche Aufgaben sollen wir ihr geben?;;Sudan y sangran, ponen esfuerzo y empeño, siempre hacia delante, impulsando el orgullo y el prestigio de nuestra nación. Los hombres y las mujeres de nuestra nación son de buena casta, y el sentimiento compartido de formar parte de una misma comunión y de compartir el mismo destino, les da la sensación de que el esfuerzo adicional realizado siempre tiene recompensa. Nuestros valores igualitarios han provocado que el pueblo de nuestra nación realice un esfuerzo añadido este año. ¿Qué hacemos con ello?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18571;We never wanted this contact with the westerners. They bring too many problems into our country, and their influence spreads like an insidious disease. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ court are calling for the borders to be closed once again, for us to display to these imperialists that they cannot simply strut about our nation as if they own it. A display of force is necessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC19350;Several witness reports over the past few years have spoken of the ongoing mistreatment of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial subjects in The Congo Free State. Widespread brutality, mutilation and even massacres have been reported as often used tools of colonial subjugation, and these reports have begun to cast the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial policy in a very poor light.

Une association internationale, l’Association pour la Réforme au Congo, a été fondée dans le but de restaurer la dignité des indigènes des colonies de l’État $COUNTRY_ADJ$. Plusieurs auteurs de renom et des humanitaires internationaux se sont joints à la cause.;Mehrere Augenzeugenberichte während der letzten Jahre verdeutlichen die kontinuierliche Misshandlung von $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Kolonialuntertanen im Kongo-Freistaat. Man berichtete, dass weitläufige Brutalität, Verstümmelungen und sogar Massaker oft als Unterwerfungsmaßnahmen eingesetzt würden, und diese Berichten haben begonnen, die $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Kolonialpolitik in äußerst schlechtem Licht erscheinen zu lassen. Nun wurde eine internationale Organisation -- die Congo Reform Association -- gegründet, die es sich auf die Fahnen geschrieben hat, die Menschenwürde der Kolonialuntertanen von $COUNTRY$ wiederherzustellen. Mehrere bekannte Autoren und internationale Verfechter der Menschenwürde haben sich für ihre Sache stark gemacht.;;Durante los últimos años, varios testigos han dado testimonio de los malos tratos que reciben los súbditos coloniales de $COUNTRY$ en el estado libre del Congo.

EVTDESC19355_NEWS_LONG;The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others) and powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its allies in the Warsaw Pact). Historians have not fully agreed on the dates, but 19471991 is common. It was termed as "cold" because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two sides, although there were major regional wars in Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan that the two sides supported. The Cold War split the temporary wartime alliance against Nazi Germany, leaving the USSR and the US as two superpowers with profound economic and political differences: the former being a single-party MarxistLeninist state, and the latter being a capitalist state with generally free elections. A self-proclaimed neutral bloc arose with the Non-Aligned Movement founded by Egypt, India, Indonesia and Yugoslavia; this faction rejected association with either the US-led West or the Soviet-led East. The two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat but they each armed heavily in preparation for a possible all-out nuclear world war. Each side had a nuclear deterrent that deterred an attack by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would lead to total destruction of the attacker: the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). ;;Geopolitische Gelehrte stimmten letzte Woche mehrheitl. überein, dass das Erstarken nationaler Stimmungen, milit.

EVTDESC21000;One of the most common killers in the 19th century was tuberculosis, an infectious disease in humans that usually targets the lungs. Known today to be caused by various strains of mycobacteria, the historical explanations for tuberculosis range from vampirism to imbalances in the 'cardinal fluids'. Known since ancient times, and first described as a contagious disease by Avicenna in 1020, typical symptoms of the disease include chronic cough, fever, and the expulsion of blood-tinged phlegm. In the 19th century, the disease was sometimes romanticized, as several famous authors and poets of the era were known sufferers.;L'une des tueuses les plus communes du 19ème siècle a été la tuberculose, une maladie infectieuse chez l'homme qui cible généralement les poumons.

Connue depuis l'antiquité, et d'abord décrite comme une maladie contagieuse par Avicenne en 1020, les symptômes typiques de la maladie comprennent la toux chronique, la fièvre, et l'expulsion de mucosités teintées de sang. Au 19e siècle, la maladie a été parfois mêlée de romantisme, car plusieurs auteurs et poètes de l'époque étaient connus en souffrir. ;Einer der größten Geißeln der Menschheit im neunzehnten Jahrhundert war die Tuberkulose, eine ansteckende Krankheit, die meistens die Lungen befällt. Heute weiß man, dass sie durch verschiedene Mykobakterien-Stämme ausgelöst wird. Historische Erklärungen der Tuberkulose reichen von Vampirismus bis zum Ungleichgewicht der 'Kardinalflüssigkeiten'. Diese Krankheit ist seit dem Altertum bekannt und wurde erstmals von Avicenna im Jahr 1020 als ansteckende Krankheit beschrieben. Typische Symptome sind chronischer Husten, Fiber und die Ausscheidung blutversetzten Schleims. Im neunzehnten Jahrhundert wurde die Krankheit manchmal im romantischen Licht gesehen, da mehrere berühmte Autoren und Dichter dieser Ära unter ihr litten.;;Uno de los exterminadores más habituales del siglo XIX fue la tuberculosis, una enfermedad infecciosa en los humanos que normalmente ataca a los pulmones. Aunque hoy se sabe que está causada por diversas variedades de micro bacterias, las explicaciones históricas abarcan desde el vampirismo a desequilibrios en los 'fluidos primordiales'. Conocida desde los tiempos antiguos, y descrita por primera vez como enfermedad contagiosa por Avicena en 1020, los síntomas típicos de la enfermedad incluyen tos crónica, fiebre y expectoración de esputos sanguinolentos. Durante el siglo XIX, la enfermedad fue, en ocasiones, idealizada, ya que varios escritores y poetas famosos la padecieron.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC21030;The 'Spanish' Flu was an influenza pandemic that killed somewhere between 50-100 million people worldwide between the years 1918 to 1920. Due to increased trade, colonial contacts, commerce and other myriads of global connections that had all increasingly made the world a smaller place throughout the 19th century, the Spanish flu was able to spread quickly across the world in a mere few years. Further aggravated by the on-going first world war, and the cramped living conditions in the trenches, the Spanish flu is one of the first and most terrifying examples of a truly global pandemic. And... come to think of it... haven't you been feeling a bit feverish, lately?;La « grippe espagnole » était une pandémie de grippe qui a tué entre 50 et 100 millions de personnes à travers le monde de 1918 à 1920. En raison de l'accroissement des échanges, des contacts coloniaux, du commerce et des myriades d'autres connexions mondiales qui avaient toutes, de plus en plus, fait du monde un endroit plus petit tout au long du 19e siècle, la grippe espagnole a pu se propager rapidement à travers le monde entier en quelques années seulement .

Verstärkte internationale Handelsbeziehungen, Kontakte mit Menschen aus Kolonien und anderweitige globale Verbindungen hatte die Welt im neunzehnten Jahrhundert zu einem kleineren Ort gemacht. Aus diesem Grund konnte sich die spanische Grippe innerhalb weniger Jahre auf der ganzen Welt verbreiten. Zusätzlich verschlimmert wurde sie durch die Kämpfe des ersten Weltkriegs und die beengten Lebensbedingungen in den Schützengräben. Die spanische Gruppe ist eine der ersten und fürchterlichsten Beispiele für eine echte globale Pandemie.

EVTDESC22000;The Trustee System, or 'Trusty System', was a corrections system originated in the U.S. state of Mississippi, but also employed in Alabama, Texas, Louisiana and others, under which prison convicts with a record of good behavior (often equated with obedience) were allowed to police other prison inmates in a strict, pseudo-military hierarchy of power, with some inmates, deemed especially trustworthy, even being allowed to carry firearms. For profit convict labor was a corner stone of the system. The trustee system was first employed on the Parchman Farm prison in Mississippi, and was, as the 19th century turned into the 20th, much lauded as a profitable and modern corrections system. Reports of widespread inmate abuses would end the system in the 1970s, but, in $YEAR$, it was all the rage in certain $COUNTRY_ADJ$ states.;Le système de confiance, ou «système de fidélité», était un système correctionnel originaire de l'État américain du Mississippi, mais aussi employé en Alabama, au Texas, en Louisiane et encore d'autres, en vertu duquel les condamnés à la prison avec un dossier de bonne conduite (souvent assimilée à de l'obédience) étaient autorisés à faire la police à d'autres détenus en une stricte hiérarchie pseudo-militaire, de plus certains détenus, jugés particulièrement dignes de confiance, étaient même autorisés à porter des armes à feu. Pour le profit, le travail des condamnés était une pierre angulaire du système. Le système de confiance fut d'abord employé sur la prison ferme de Parchman dans le Mississippi, et était, autant au 19ème siècle qu'au 20e, vanté comme un rentable et moderne système correctionnel. Des allégations répandues de mauvais traitements des détenus mettront fin au système dans les années 1970, mais, actuellement en $YEAR$, il fait fureur dans certains Etats $COUNTRY_ADJ$.;Das Trustee System, oder auch 'Trusty System', war ein Strafvollzugssystem, das im US-Bundesstaat entwickelt wurde, aber auch in Alabama, Texas, Louisiana und anderen Bundesstaaten Anwendung fand.

Einige Insassen, die als besonders vertrauenswürdig eingestuft wurden, durften dabei sogar Schusswaffen tragen. Hinsichtlich des Profits stellte die Arbeit der Gefangenen die Basis des Systems da. Das Trustee System wurde zum ersten Mal in einem Gefängnis in Mississippi angewandt, das auch als Parchman Farm bekannt ist. Während des ausgehenden neunzehnten und beginnenden zwanzigsten Jahrhundert wurde dieses System sehr als profitables und modernes Strafvollzugsverfahren gepriesen. Berichte von umfassendem Missbrauch von Gefangen bedeuteten Ende der 1970er Jahre das Ende des Systems, aber im Jahr $YEAR$ war es in bestimmten $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Staaten wieder in Mode.;;El sistema de reclusos de confianza, o 'Trusty System', fue un sistema penal originado en el estado norteamericano de Mississippi, pero empleado también, en Alabama, Texas, Louisiana y otros, bajo el cual reclusos con un expediente de buen comportamiento (a menudo equiparado con la obediencia) podían custodiar a otros reclusos, dentro de una estricta jerarquía de poder pseudo militar, permitiendo incluso que algunos de estos reclusos, especialmente considerados dignos de confianza, pudieran llevar armas de fuego. Para que el trabajo forzado fuera provechoso resultó una piedra angular del sistema. El sistema de reclusos de confianza fue utilizado por primera vez en la granja prisión de Parchman, en Mississippi, y, mientras el siglo XIX daba paso al XX, fue muy alabado como sistema penal moderno y provechoso.

EVTDESC22010;The idea of isolating offenders and breachers of the public peace from society in general is probably as old as time itself. Many classical systems of justice included banishment from the realm as a last resort type of punishment, reserved for serious crimes and offences, and such punishment was not seldom considered worse than a death penalty. With the growth of the European colonial empires during the 18th and 19th centuries, these ideas received a modern incarnation in the form of the penal colony, with renowned (or infamous) examples being the British colony at Botany Bay and the French 'Devil's Island' in French Guiana. Since $COUNTRY$ occupies several territories that could be well suited for such a purpose, perhaps we ourselves should consider establishing such institutions?;"L'idée d'isoler les délinquants et les violeurs pour la paix de la société en général, est sans doute aussi vieille que le temps lui-même. De nombreux systèmes classiques de justice incluent le bannissement du royaume comme type de dernier recours de la peine, réservé pour des crimes graves, et le châtiment n'était pas considéré pire que la peine de mort. Avec la croissance des empires coloniaux européens au cours des 18e et 19e siècles, ces idées ont reçu une incarnation moderne sous la forme de la colonie pénitentiaire, avec les célèbres (ou infâmes) exemples qu'étaient la colonie britannique à ""Botany Bay"" et la française ""île du diable"" en Guyane. Alors que $COUNTRY$ occupe plusieurs territoires qui pourraient être bien adaptés à cette fin, peut-être nous-mêmes devrions-nous envisager de créer de telles institutions ? ";Die Idee, Straftäter von der Gesellschaft zu isolieren ist wahrscheinlich einer der ältesten Ideen überhaupt. Viele klassische Rechtssysteme verfügten den Ausschluss aus dem Reich als äußerstes Strafmaß, das für schwere Verbrechen vorbehalten blieb und oft schlimmer als die Todesstrafe empfunden wurde. Mit dem Aufstieg der europäischen Kolonialreiche während des achtzehnten und neunzehnten Jahrhunderts wurde diese Idee in Form der Strafkolonie wieder aufgenommen. Berühmte bzw. berüchtigte Beispiele sind die britische Strafkolonie in Botany Bay und die französische 'Teufelsinsel' in Französisch-Guayana. Da $COUNTRY$ viele solcher Territorien besetzt hält, die für eine Strafkolonie gut geeignet wären, sollten wir uns vielleicht überlegen, solche Kolonien zu errichten ...;;La idea de aislar a los delincuentes y a los alteradores de la paz pública del grueso de la sociedad es, probablemente, casi tan vieja como el propio tiempo. Muchos sistemas judiciales clásicos incluían el destierro como castigo de último recurso, reservado para crímenes y delitos graves, y tal castigo se consideraba muy a menudo peor que la pena capital. Con el crecimiento de los imperios coloniales europeos durante los siglos XVIII y XIX, tales ideas adquirieron su encarnación moderna en la forma de la colonia penal, con famosos (o infames) ejemplos como la colonia británica en Botany Bay o la 'Isla del diablo' francesa, en la Guayana francesa. Ya que $COUNTRY$ ocupa varios territorios que se ajustarían bien a tal propósito, ¿podríamos considera nosotros, quizá,el establecimiento de instituciones parecidas?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC22070;As the 19th century dawned on Europe, the practice of jailing people who defaulted on their debts was still norm. In England, infamous examples of such institutions - Debtor's Prisons - include London's Fleet Prison. In these institutions debtors where not seldom expected to pay for both board and room, and sometimes even special 'Jailor's Fees', to effectively pay their jailors for their upkeep. Often times, these practices only served to further complicate the debtor's financial situation, as it for natural reasons is hard to earn money from inside a prison wall. The system was gradually abandoned in most European countries throughout the 19th century, and London's Fleet Prison was torn down in 1846. A wrongly jailed $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocrat is now drawing public attention to these institutions, calling for their abolishment.;A l'aube du 19ème siècle sur l'Europe, les personnes emprisonnées par manque de remboursement de dettes restent la norme en Angleterre, avec des exemples de célèbres institutions  les prisons des débiteurs - notamment celle de la prison londonienne de la flotte.

Manchmal mussten sie sogar zusätzliche 'Jailor's Fees' entrichten, um den Unterhalt der Gefängnisse, in den sie einsaßen, zu sichern. Oftmals wurde die finanzielle Situation eines inhaftierten Schuldners dadurch nur noch verschlimmert, da das Geldverdienen hinter Gefängnismauern selbstverständlich sehr mühsam war.

Mis au point contre l'irrévocabilité de la peine, en tandem avec le risque toujours présent d'une sentence injustifiée, les libéraux se sont réunis pour former un comité de citoyens s'engageant à l'abolir. Le débat a été incité par la récente exécution, très médiatisée, d'un homme âgé reconnu coupable du meurtre de sa femme, malgré le fait que l'homme était clairement dans un stade avancé de démence liée à l'âge. Le comité nouvellement créé invite les députés à se prononcer contre ce qu'ils considèrent être la plus horrible des injustices, et il recherche audience auprès du cabinet pour expliquer sa position.;Eine Debatte im $CAPITAL$-Reformverein über die Todesstrafe hat heute Nacht neue Argumente gegen die Todesstrafe geliefert. Wichtigste Punkte dabei waren die Unwiderruflichkeit des Todesurteils und das allgegenwärtige Risiko einer ungerechten Verurteilung. Liberale machen jetzt mit einem Bürgerkomitee zur Abschaffung der Todesstrafe gemeinsame Sache. Die Debatte wurde durch die stark publizierte, vor kurzem vollzogene Hinrichtung eines betagten Ehrenmannes für den Mord an seiner Frau ausgelöst, obwohl der Mann ganz eindeutig bereits stark dement war. Das neugegründete Komitee ruft Parlamentsmitglieder auf, sich gegen diese in ihren Augen entsetzliche Ungerechtigkeit auszusprechen, und haben beim Parlament um eine Audienz gebeten, um ihren Standpunkt darzulegen.;;Esta noche, dentro de un debate en el 'Reform Club' de $CAPITAL$ sobre la pena capital, los oponentes a dicho castigo han visto cómo sus nuevos argumentos ganaban terreno. Centrándose en la irrevocabilidad del castigo, en conjunción con el riesgo siempre presente de un error en el dictamen de la sentencia, los liberales se han unido para formar un comité ciudadano para abolir la condena. Le debate se ha producido a raíz de la reciente y muy difundida ejecución de un anciano gentilhombre condenado por el asesinato de su esposa, a pesar de que el hombre presentaba claros síntomas de un avanzado estado de demencia senil. El recién fundado demanda a los miembros del parlamento que se pronuncien en contra de lo que consideran la más horrenda de las injusticias, y han solicitado audiencia con el consejo de ministros para exponer su postura.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC23302;The renowned French marine biologist Pierre Arronax was found washed up on the shores of $COUNTRY$ today. The professor has been gone for quite some time since joining an expedition sent out to discover the truth behind a mysterious whale said to sink and devour ships on the high seas. The professor is shocked by the profound experience he has had, and his story is indeed remarkable. Arronax claims that he was washed overboard during a close encounter between his ship and the creature, and that the creature is in fact a human ship, capable of under water travel. Arronax maintains that the ship is, or was, commanded by a freedom-loving vigilante who has sworn off all contact with terra firma in favor of a free life on the world's oceans aboard his ship. Whatever the truth, Professor Arronax's many detailed accounts of many strange new life forms -- supposedly encountered during his voyage as a guest aboard this strange vessel -- will be a boon for our scientific efforts for years to come.;Le célèbre spécialiste français de biologie marine a été découvert aujourd’hui rejeté par la mer sur une plage du pays : $COUNTRY$.

Der Professor ist von seinen tiefgreifenden Erlebnissen schockiert, und seine Geschichte ist wahrlich beachtenswert. Arronax behauptet, dass er bei einem Aufeinandertreffen mit der Kreatur über Bord ging, und dass es sich bei der Kreatur in Wahrheit um ein von Menschen gesteuertes Schiff handle, das unter Wasser fahren kann. Arronax behauptet weiter, dass dieses Schiff von einem freiheitsliebenden Eigenbrötler kommandiert wird oder wurde, der sich jeglichem Kontakt mit dem Festland abgeschworen hat und lieber an Bord seines Schiffes ein Leben in Freiheit auf den Ozeanen dieser Welt lebt.

With living and health conditions in the cities worsening on account of overcrowding, pollution and poor housing, some people, predominantly from the middle classes, have come to yearn again for the peace and quiet of country life, and, with living standards and wages increasing, more and more people can also afford the occasional trip out of town for some rest and recreation in the fresh open air of a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ country side.;Il vit dans une maison, une maison très grande, à la campagne.\n\nAvec nos centres urbains s’accroissant de jour en jour, un flux constant de fermiers issus de nos campagnes se déversent en ville.

En effet, avec des conditions de vie urbaine qui empirent à cause de la surpopulation et du manque de logement, certains, principalement issus des classes moyennes, sont venus à la campagne pour chercher paix et tranquilité vie.

EVTDESC3003;Aye, I'd say they fed the pigs better than they ever did us.'\n\nA local scandal coming out of one of our states has garnered a fair amount of national attention during the last few weeks. Apparently, a foreman at one of the local workhouses has embezzled public funds allotted to him, and recovered the losses by serving poorer quality food, sometimes not more than a few slices of bread each day, to the people employed by the institution. The case has become a soap-box for conservatives and liberals alike, with conservatives arguing against government intervention and liberals arguing the need for more social reforms.;C’est pas normal, les porcs étaient mieux nourris que nous !\n\nUn scandale dans une de nos régions a bénéficié d’une audience nationale durant ces dernières semaines. Apparemment un dirigeant d’une institution publique a détourné des fonds du gouvernement alloués à cette dernière en y servant de la nourriture de mauvaise qualité et en empochant la différence. La nourriture était très mauvaise, parfois pas plus que quelques tranches de pain pour toute une journée. Ce cas est devenu une pomme de discorde entre conservateurs et libéraux, les premiers arguant contre l'intervention du gouvernement et les seconds insistant sur le besoin de réformes sociales.;Jawollja, ick würde schon sagen, dat se die Schweine immer schon besser jefüttert ham als uns.'\n\nEin lokaler Skandal aus einem unserer Staaten hat in den letzten Wochen eine Menge nationaler Aufmerksamkeit auf sich gezogen. Es scheint, dass ein Vorarbeiter in einem der örtlichen Arbeitshäuser ihm anvertraute Gelder unterschlug und die Verluste dadurch aufwog, in dem er den dort angestellten Menschen schlechtere Mahlzeiten anbot, manchmal nur ein paar Scheiben Brot pro Tag. Der Fall ist ein gefundenes Fressen für Konservative wie Liberale geworden, wobei die Konservativen gegen Regierungsintervention argumentieren und die Liberalen nach mehr Sozialreformen verlangen.;;Sí, diría que alimentaban mejor a los cerdos que a nosotros.\n\nUn escándalo local en uno de nuestros estados ha atraído la atención nacional durante las últimas semanas. Aparentemente, el jefe de uno de las casas taller locales ha malversado fondos públicos y ha recuperado las pérdidas sirviendo comida de peor calidad (a veces tan solo unas rebanadas de pan al día), a la gente empleada por la institución.

EVTDESC3005;Thus, an additional few thousand dead this year can be attributed to the ravages of tuberculosis in our state.'\n\nA local physician's privately published report on the state of health care in his home state has caused a small public uproar in $COUNTRY$. Among general talk of the unsanitary and cramped living conditions that the disease seems to thrive on, the report is also severely critical of the government for not doing more in preventing the spread of tuberculosis by a stricter policy of quarantine, and for not providing adequate facilities for treatment.

Konservative verspotten den Bericht als hysterische Polemik, und eine freundliche Reaktion unsererseits auf den Bericht könnte sie verärgern. Auf der anderen Seite könnten wir schon ein Sanitarium gebrauchen.;;Por tanto, este año pueden achacarse miles de muertos adicionales a los estragos que ha causado la tuberculosis en nuestro estado.\n\nUn médico local ha publicado un informe sobre el estado de la sanidad pública en su estado natal que ha provocado un pequeño escándalo en $COUNTRY$. Además de los comentarios generales de las condiciones de vida lamentables que los enfermos tienen que soportar, el informe es muy crítico con el gobierno por no haber prevenido mejor la propagación de la tuberculosis, con una política de cuarentena estricta y por no contar con instalaciones adecuadas para su tratamiento.

While the article isn't slanderous per se, it is having a clear impact on the reputation and good name of the politician in question. The public has found the incident amusing, and the politician is now fast becoming the running gag of the town. The politician himself, angry at this attack upon his character, has petitioned the local court to ban the newspaper on grounds of 'breach of morality and public trust'. Shutting down the paper will rouse liberals in the state, but not doing it will increase the support for press reforms.;"Le journal le ""télégramme du jour"", largement diffusé dans une de nos régions, a publié un article racontant, d'une façon plutôt pittoresque, les détails de la vie amoureuse d’un politicien local apparemment bien volage.

Le public a trouvé l’histoire amusante, et le politicien est maintenant devenu la risée de toute la région. Celui-ci, en colère contre le journal, a saisi le tribunal local pour l’interdire en raison d’infractions à la moralité et à la confiance publique.

Die Öffentlichkeit fand den Vorfall amüsant, und der Politiker ist nun zur Lachnummer der Stadt geworden. Verärgert über diesen Angriff auf seinen Charakter, hat der Politiker das lokale Gericht gebeten, aufgrund des angenommenen 'Verstoßes gegen die Moral und das öffentliche Vertrauen' die Zeitung zu verbieten. Eine Schließung der Zeitung wird die Liberalen des Staates auf die Barrikaden bringen, aber nicht einzuschreiten, bedeutet mehr Unterstützung für Medienreformen.;;El Daily Telegraph, de distribución en uno de nuestros estados, ha publicado un artículo en el que expone, de un modo bastante gráfico, los detalles de la vida sentimental de un político local que, aparentemente se extiende mucho más allá de los confines de su hogar y su esposa.

Al público le parece divertido el incidente y el político se está convirtiendo con rapidez en el hazmerreír de la ciudad.

EVTDESC32505;In 1880, Fyodor Dostoevsky completed his magnum opus, 'The Brothers Karamazov'. One of the most arresting works in the entire history of literature, 'The Brothers Karamazov' was a comedy that developed the major themes of Dostoevsky's post-Socialist career as a writer. A comedy, perhaps, but arguably the most serious comedy ever written. In his memoir, 'The Diary of a Writer', Dostoevsky dismissed leftist criticisms of his work by remarking that no leftist had ever provided as damaging a critique of Christianity as his Chapters 'Rebellion' and 'The Grand Inquisitor' in The Brothers Karamazov. Dostoevsky's works were hugely influential not only in Russia but also throughout the West,  and not only in literary circles, but in philosophical and religious ones as well.;"En 1880, Fiodor Dostoïevski a terminé son magnum opus, «les frères Karamazov». Une des œuvres la plus frappante dans toute l'histoire de la littérature, «les frères Karamazov» est une comédie qui a développé les grands thèmes de la carrière post-socialiste de Dostoïevski en tant qu'écrivain. Une comédie, peut-être, mais sans doute la comédie plus sérieuse jamais écrite. Dans ses mémoires, ""le journal d'un écrivain"", Dostoïevski a rejeté ses détracteurs de gauche sur son travail en faisant remarquer qu'aucun de gauche n'avait jamais fourni une aussi préjudiciable critique du christianisme comme dans ses chapitres «rébellion» et «le grand inquisiteur». Les œuvres de Dostoïevski ont eu une influence considérable non seulement en Russie mais aussi dans tout l'Occident, et pas seulement dans les cercles littéraires, mais dans ceux philosophiques et religieux tout aussi bien. ";1880 vollendete Fjodor Dostojewski die Arbeit an seinem Opus Magnum 'Die Brüder Karamasow'. Bei diesem Buch, einem der fesselndsten literarischen Werke der Menschheitsgeschichte, handelt es sich um eine Komödie, die sich um Dostojewskis post-sozialistische Karriere als Autor dreht. Es ist jedoch eine der ernstesten Komödien, die jemals geschrieben wurde. Dostojewski schmetterte in seinen Memoiren 'Tagebuch eines Autors' linke Kritik ab, indem er bemerkte, dass kein Linker jemals solch aufrüttelnde Kritik an der Christenheit geübt hätte, wie es in den Kapiteln 'Rebellion' und 'Der Großinquisitor' von 'Die Brüder Karamasow' getan worden wäre. Dostojewskis Werke übten nicht nur in Russland, sondern auch im gesamten Westen großen Einfluss aus. Dies beschränkte sich nicht nur auch Literaturzirkel, sondern galt auch für Philosophen und Geistliche.;Los hermanos Karamazov;En 1880, Fiodor Dostoiesvski terminó su obra magna 'Los hermanos Karamazov'. Una de las más sugerentes obras literarias de la historia, 'Los hermanos Karamazov' era una comedia que desarrollaba los temas principales de su carrera como escritor postsocialista. Puede que se tratase de una comedia, pero tal vez fuera la comedia más seria jamás escrita. En sus memorias, 'El diario de un escritor', Dostoievski rechazó las acusaciones de la izquierda a su trabajo diciendo que ningún izquierdista había escrito una crítica del cristianismo más devastadora que los capítulos 'Rebelión' y 'El Gran Inquisidor' de 'Los Hermanos Karamazov'. Las obras de Dostoievski tuvieron una gran influencia, no sólo en Rusia, sino en todo occidente, y no sólo en círculos literarios, sino también filosóficos y religiosos.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC3301;As our average life expectancies have increased over the years, more and more families have had to take care of their elderly who are no longer able to provide for themselves. The social makeup of our country is changing, and without much in way of a national plan for the elderly and the disabled, a lot are falling between the cracks in the system. Conservatives have by and large taken the stance that the family is the first and last social support structure for the elderly, and that an increasing role for government in the area threatens to unravel important societal bonds. Liberals, on the other hand, see our pensions as tragically lacking, pointing to the many who, seemingly, go without aid.;À mesure que l'espérance de vie moyenne augmente au cours des dernières années, de plus en plus de familles ont dû prendre soin de leurs personnes âgées devenues dépendantes. L'aspect social de notre pays change, et sans un plan national pour les personnes âgées et les handicapés, beaucoup de ces personnes se retrouveront marginalisées. Les conservateurs arguent généralement que le famille est la première et dernière structure de soutien pour les personnes âgées, et qu'un rôle croissant de l'Etat dans le secteur est une atteinte aux liens familiaux fondamentaux. Les libéraux, d'autre part, constatent que les pensions de retraite sont trop peu distribuées car de nombreuses personnes dépendantes restent sans aide sociale.;Mit steigender Lebenserwartung über die Jahre hinweg müssen immer mehr Familien sich um ihre älteren Familienmitglieder kümmern, die nicht länger für sich selbst sorgen können. Das soziale Gefüge unseres Landes ändert sich, und ohne einen nationalen Plan für die Alten und Versehrten fallen viele durch die Lücken des Systems. Konservative haben im Allgemeinen den Standpunkt eingenommen, dass die Familie die erste und letzte Unterstützung für die Alten ist, und dass eine größere Rolle der Regierung hierbei droht, wichtige soziale Bindungen aufzulösen. Liberale, auf der anderen Seite, sehen einen tragischen Mangel an Renten und verweisen auf die vielen Menschen, die scheinbar ohne Hilfe auskommen müssen.;;Como nuestra esperanza de vida ha aumentado a lo largo de los años, cada vez más familias deben ocuparse de sus ancianos, que ya no pueden valerse por sí mismos. La configuración social de nuestro país está cambiando y, sin nada parecido a un plan nacional para ayudar a los ancianos y discapacitados, muchos están cayendo por las grietas del sistema. Los conservadores han apostado en su mayoría por el hecho de que la familia es el primer y último apoyo social para los mayores y que un aumento del papel del estado en esa área amenazaría con desatar importantes vínculos sociales. Los liberales, por otra parte, consideran que nuestras pensiones tienen graves carencias y señalan que muchos se quedan desamparados.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC3302;I have, in my overview of government policy, been careful not to attribute to malice that which can reasonably be attributed to sheer stupidity. The task has been daunting at times.'\n\nOur pensions system has come under attack by opposition within the ruling party. Aside from various administrative complaints against the system, the focal point of the critique seems to be that the pensions are, quite simply, too low. Some sort of response would be in order.;J'ai, dans mon interprétation d'ensemble de la politique de gouvernement, fait attention à ne pas attribuer à la méchanceté ce qui pouvait raisonnablement être attribué à de la simple stupidité. La tâche a été parfois difficile. \n\n Notre système de retraite a fait l'objet d'attaques menées par des opposants au sein même de la majorité au pouvoir. Hormis l'aspect trop bureaucratique du système, le point essentiel de ces critiques semble être que les pensions sont, tout simplement, beaucoup trop basses. Une réponse aux critiques serait souhaitable.;In meinem Überblick über die Regierungspolitik bin ich sorgsam vorgegangen, um nicht einfach schierer Bosheit zuzuschreiben, was ganz vernünftigen Argumenten nach einfach der schieren Blödheit zugeschrieben werden kann. Die Aufgabe war manchmal herkulisch.'\n\nUnser Rentensystem ist von Teilen der Regierungspartei angegriffen worden. Abgesehen von verschiedenen Beschwerden gegen das Verwaltungssystem scheint der Fokus der Kritik zu sein, dass die Renten einfach zu niedrig sind. Es wäre angemessen, irgendwie darauf zu reagieren.;;En mi resumen de la política gubernamental, he tenido cuidado de no atribuir a la malicia lo que se puede explicar como fruto de la simple estupidez. A veces, la tarea ha sido todo un reto.\n\nNuestro sistema de pensiones es objeto de ataques por parte de la oposición al partido gobernante.

EVTDESC3303;Me 'ole lyfe I've been workin' hard, an' what do I get nuw? Gruel.'\n\nThe pensions system has been on everyone's lips and minds the past week, with the publication of a parliamentary report on the pensions system. The report is fairly nuanced in its overall conclusions about the system, but the issue that has stuck with people is an attached case-study interview with an elderly gentleman left out of the pensions system on what seems like mere technicalities, who complains about having worked hard all his life, but now being fed nothing but gruel.;J'ai travaillé dur tout'ma vie et qu'est-ce j'en r'tire maintenant ?... Du gruau !... \n\nLe système de retraite est dans tous les esprits depuis la semaine dernière avec la publication d'un rapport parlementaire le concernant. Le rapport est assez équilibré dans ses conclusions mais ce que les gens ont retenu est l'exemple donné d'un vieil homme qui après une vie de labeur est laissé en dehors du système et ne dispose que d'un simple gruau pour toute nourriture.;Mein janzes Leben hann isch hart jearbeitet, un wat krie' isch nu dafür? Jrützbrei krie' isch.'\n\nDas Rentensystem war die letzte Woche lang in jedermanns Munde, da ein Parliamentsbericht über das Rentensystem veröffentlicht wurde. Der Bericht ist generell sehr nuanciert in seinen Schlussfolgerungen über das System, aber was den Menschen im Gedächtnis haften bleibt, ist eine angefügte Fallstudie - ein Interview mit einem älteren Herrn, der aus bloßen technischen Gründen durch das Rentennetz fiel, und der sich beschwert, sein Leben lang hart gearbeitet zu haben, aber nun nichts als Grütze zu essen bekommt.;;He trabajado duro toda la vida. ¿Y qué tengo a cambio? Gachas.\n\nEl sistema de pensiones ha estado en la boca y cabezas de todos durante la semana pasada, con la publicación de un informe parlamentario sobre el sistema de pensiones. El informe se ve matizado por sus conclusiones generales sobre el sistema, pero el asunto con el que ha chocado la gente es un estudio adjunto con una entrevista a un anciano caballero que ha quedado fuera del sistema de pensiones por lo que parecen meros tecnicismos, que se queja de haber trabajado duro toda la vida y no tener más que gachas para comer.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC3304;"And while our hard pressed economy is bleeding massive sums into the pensions system, alarming concerns are at the same time being raised about the systematic exploitation of the system, with children at the age of thirteen in some cases being listed as recipients!\n\nMassive debates in parliament today as the Committee on Pensions and Living Standards today disbanded without submitting its final report. Apparently, internal conflict in the bi-partisan committee over hearing procedures has become a terminal stumbling block. The resulting confusion in parliament could be exploited to quickly rescind some of the more costly welfare reforms.""";Et tandis que notre économie aux abois engloutit des sommes massives dans le système des retraites, le problème est accru par une exploitation illégale du système conduisant à voir des enfants de treize ans bénéficier d'une pension ! \n\n Des débats houleux ont eu lieu aujourd'hui au parlement avec la dissolution du comité des pensions et du niveau de vie avant même que celui-ci ne puisse rendre son rapport final. Il semblerait que le mode de fonctionnement bipartisan de ce comité ait entrainé des conflits internes et l'interruption des auditions d'experts. La confusion en résultant pourrait être exploitée pour annuler rapidement certaines des réformes d'assistance sociale les plus coûteuses.;"Und während unsere schon in den Seilen hängende Wirtschaft massive Summen in das Rentensystem kanalisiert, werden zugleich alarmierende Bedenken laut über die systematische Ausnutzung des Systems, wobei in manchen Fällen dreizehnjährige Kinder als Empfänger aufgelistet werden!""\n\nMassive Debatten heute im Parlament, als das Kommittee für Renten und Lebensstandards sich auflöste, ohne seinen finalen Bericht abzugeben. Offensichtlich ist in diesem Zweiparteienkommittee ein interner Konflikt um Hearingmethoden zu einem unüberwindlichen Hindernis geworden. Die daraus resultierende Verwirrung im Parlament könnte man ausnutzen, um schnell einige der teureren Wohlfahrtsreformen wieder zu kappen.";;Mientras nuestra ya congestionada economía sigue derivando sumas masivas al sistema de pensiones, se empieza a dar la voz de alarma acerca del abuso masivo del sistema. ¡En algunos casos hay niños de trece años inscritos como beneficiarios!\n\nHoy se han producido grandes debates en el Parlamento cuando el Comité de Pensiones y Calidad de Vida se marchó sin exponer su informe final.

EVTDESC3305;Since I was a boy, for all my life, I've marched. Up and down, and back and forth, I've marched with the firm conviction that I would die young, in service of the country that I hold dearer than any other under the sun. Yet, now, when my life draws to more peaceful ends, I cannot help but notice that I am old.'\n\nWhile life expectancies in $COUNTRY$ are decidedly on the increase, the unfortunate interaction between a relatively low wage, and equally low pensions, means that very few people can afford to make preparations for an old age where they are no longer capable of working. The educated middle classes would prefer to see a raise in the minimum wage, while the aristocracy argues in favor of raising pensions.;Depuis que je suis petit garçon, et durant toute ma vie, j'ai avancé en ce monde avec la ferme conviction que je mourrai jeune mais au service de mon cher pays. Cependant, maintenant que ma vie arrive à son terme, je ne peux que constater mon grand âge. \n\nL'espérance de vie en $COUNTRY$ est en nette augmentation. Mais la conjonction difficile entre un faible salaire, et des pensions tout aussi faibles signifie que très peu de personnes peuvent se permettre de préparer leur vieillesse dans des conditions décentes. Les classes moyennes instruites préféreraient voir le salaire minimum augmenter, alors que l'aristocratie plaide en faveur d'un accroissement des pensions de retraite.;Seit ich ein Junge war, bin ich marschiert - mein ganzes Leben lang. Rauf und runter, vor und zurück, so bin ich in der festen Überzeugung marschiert, dass ich jung sterben würde, im Dienste des Landes, das ich mehr liebe als jedes andere unter der Sonne. Doch nun, da mein Leben sich einem friedlicheren Ende zuneigt, kann ich nicht übersehen, dass ich alt bin.'\n\nWährend die Lebenserwartung in $COUNTRY$ entschieden steigt, bedeuten die unglückliche Interaktion von relativ niedrigen Löhnen und gleichsam niedrigen Renten, dass sich nur wenige Menschen auf das Alter vorbereiten können, wenn sie nicht mehr in der Lage sind, zu arbeiten. Der gebildete Mittelstand würde gerne den Grundlohn anheben, während die Aristokratie für höhere Renten plädiert.;;He marchado desde que era niño, durante toda mi vida. Arriba y abajo, de aquí para allá, he marchado con la firme convicción de que moriría joven al servicio del país al que amo más que a ningún otro del mundo. Sin embargo, ahora que mi vida llega a un final más apacible, no puedo evitar darme cuenta de que soy viejo. \n\nAunque la esperanza de vida en $COUNTRY$ va decididamente al alza, la desafortunada combinación de bajos ingresos y bajas pensiones hace que muy poca gente pueda permitirse hacer preparativos para cuando lleguen a la vejez y no puedan trabajar más. Las clases medias educadas preferirían que se solucionase aumentando el salario mínimo, mientras que la aristocracia defiende un aumento de las pensiones.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC35700;Pope Leo XIII's encyclical on the 'Rights and Duties of Capital and Labour' began with the words 'Rerum Novarum'. In the encyclical's analysis, the spirit of socialist revolutionary change had begun to pervade ever more areas. The causes of the conflict, it claimed, were clear: The vast expansion of industrial pursuits, the changed relations between masters and workmen, the accumulation of enormous fortunes by a few individuals and the utter poverty of the masses, and the prevailing moral degeneracy.  The encyclical argued that Socialism threatened the religious and moral foundation of the state and sought to break the common interests of the Church and State, the employer and the employed, and replace them with an evil, atheist doctrine. To counter this threat, associations must be formed that satisfy the needs of progress and yet protect the weak. The encyclical quoted the Apostle Paul saying that 'Charity is patient, is kind ... seeketh not her own ... suffereth all things ... endureth all things'.;L'encyclique du pape Léon XIII sur les «droits et devoirs du capital et du travail» commence avec les mots «Rerum Novarum». D'après l'analyse de l'encyclique, l'esprit de changement révolutionnaire socialiste a commencé à envahir de plus en plus de zones. Les causes du conflit, selon elle, sont claires : la vaste expansion des activités industrielles, les relations changées entre patrons et ouvriers, l'accumulation de fortunes énormes par quelques individus et la pauvreté extrême des masses, ou encore la dégénérescence morale qui prévaut. L'encyclique fait valoir que le socialisme menace la fondation religieuse et morale de l'État et cherche à briser les intérêts communs de l'Église et l'État, de l'employeur et de l'employé, et les remplacer par un mal, la doctrine athée. Pour contrer cette menace, des associations doivent être formées qui répondront aux besoins de progrès et devront déjà protéger les faibles. L'encyclique cite l'apôtre Paul disant que «la charité est patiente, en quelque sorte ... ne cherche pas le sien ... souffre toutes choses ... supporte toutes les choses». ;Die Enzyklika von Papst Leo XIII. über die 'Rechten und Pflichten des Kapitals und der Arbeit' beginnt mit den Worten 'Rerum Novarum'. Der Geist der sozialistischen Revolution hat sich in immer mehr Gebieten verbreitet. Die Ursachen für die Konflikte sind klar: Die starke Ausdehnung industrieller Interessen, das veränderte Verhältnis zwischen Herren und Arbeitern, der enorme Reichtum einzelner Individuen, völlige Armut der Massen und die herrschende moralische Entartung. Der Sozialismus bedroht das religiöse und moralische Fundament der Kirche und scheint mit den allgemeinen Interessen der Kirche, des Staats, der Arbeitgeber und der Arbeitnehmer zu kollidieren und sie durch eine böse atheistische Doktrin zu ersetzen. Es müssen Vereinigungen geschaffen werden, die sowohl den erforderlichen Fortschritt befriedigen als auch die Schwachen beschützen können. Wie sagte schon der Apostel Paulus: 'Nächstenliebe ist geduldig und fromm, ... suchet nicht ihresgleichen, ... erleidet alle Dinge, ... erduldet alle Dinge.';Rerum Novarum;La encíclica del papa León XIII sobre los 'Derechos y obligaciones del capital y el trabajador' comienza con las palabras 'Rerum Novarum'. En su análisis, el espíritu del cambio revolucionario socialista había empezado a extenderse a más áreas que nunca. Las causas del conflicto eran: la expansión de las actividades industriales, el cambio de relaciones entre patronos y trabajadores, la acumulación de fortunas en unos cuantos y la pobreza de las masas, y la degeneración moral imperante. Argumentaba que el socialismo amenazaba la religiosidad y la moral del estado y pretendía la ruptura de los intereses comunes de la Iglesia y el Estado, del empresario y el empleado, y los sustituía por una doctrina malvada y atea. Para contrarrestar tal amenaza, debían formarse asociaciones que satisficieran las necesidades de progreso e incluso protegieran al débil. Se citaba al apóstol San Pablo: 'La caridad es paciente, es servicial... no busca su interés... todo lo sufre... todo lo soporta'.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC3602;An almost new idea has been adopted by the construction workers of $COUNTRY$: safety helmets. The first ones to be used were old combat helmets which war veterans had given to their sons, and after the helmets have saved one worker's life, others began wearing similar headgear to work. Sometimes old kettles or cauldrons were even used, after a bit of modification. This has improved the safety at the building sites and very few workers are hurt by accidentally dropped tools or other things.;Une attitude nouvelle s’est répandue parmi les travailleurs du bâtiment de $COUNTRY$ : le port de casques de sécurité. Les premiers casques employés étaient de vieux casques de combat que les anciens combattants avaient donné à leurs fils. La vie d’un ouvrier ayant été sauvée par un de ces casques, d'autres ont commencé à porter des protections semblables. Des bouilloires ou de vieux chaudrons ont même été utilisés, après quelques modifications. Ceci a amélioré la sécurité sur les chantiers et très peu d'ouvriers se sont retrouvés blessés accidentellement à la tête par des outils ou par autre chose.;Eine fast neue Idee wurde von den Bauarbeitern in $COUNTRY$ in die Praxis umgesetzt: Schutzhelme. Die ersten waren alte Militärkampfhelme, die Kriegsveteranen ihren Söhnen gegeben hatten, und nachdem ein Helm das Leben eines Arbeiters gerettet hatte, begannen andere, ähnlichen Kopfputz zur Arbeit zu tragen. Manchmal wurden selbst alte Kessel und Töpfe umfunktioniert. Dies hat die Sicherheit auf den Baustellen erhöht, und mittlerweile werden nur noch sehr wenige Arbeiter durch fallengelassene Gegenstände verletzt.;;Los obreros de la construcción de $COUNTRY$ han adoptado una idea prácticamente nueva: cascos de seguridad. Los primeros que se utilizaron fueron viejos cascos de guerra que los veteranos de guerra les habían dado a sus hijos, Después de que estos cascos hubiesen salvado más de una vida. otros empezaron a llevar protecciones similares al trabajo. A veces, con unas pocas modificaciones se llegaron a utilizar viejos calderos y teteras.

EVTDESC3756;People have taken to the streets in one of our states, exasperated over the lack of political representation, and held a rally, calling on the government to institute political reform. While the rally has largely been a peaceful affair, several incendiary speeches were held during it, and tensions between conservatives and liberals are running high. Local aristocrats are calling on the government to condemn the speeches made at the rally, and muster support for holding back political reforms and protect the established order.

Les aristocrates locaux demandent au gouvernement de condamner les discours prononcés lors de la manifestation, et de mobiliser le soutien pour freiner les réformes politiques et protéger l'ordre établi.

Lokale Aristokraten fordern die Regierung auf, die auf der Kundgebung gehaltenen Reden zu verdammen, Unterstützung für die Nichteinsetzung politischer Reformen zu finden, und die etablierte Ordnung zu schützen. Unterstützung der Aristokraten bedeutet, die örtlichen Progressiven zu verärgern, aber Nichtstun würde den Zorn sowohl der Konservativen als auch der Aristokraten schüren.;;La gente ha tomado las calles de uno de nuestros estados, exasperada por la carencia de representación política y han organizado un mitin para exigir al gobierno que instituya una reforma política.

Los aristócratas locales han pedido al gobierno que condene los discursos hechos en el mitin y han buscado apoyo para evitar la reforma política y proteger el orden establecido.

The tract argues in favor of a variant of the Jefferson method for appointing representatives to the Upper House. The Jefferson method is a highest averages method, and the purpose of it is to allocate seats in proportion to the number of votes a particular party list has received, by maintaining the ratio of votes received to seats allocated as close as possible. The tract has received a fair amount of both national and international attention. The publication gives us a window of opportunity to try to reform our voting system, but we could perhaps be content with some international prestige on account of the publication instead? What is the government's position?;Un professeur à l'un de nos plus prestigieuses universités a publié un tract sur la philosophie politique. Il plaide en faveur d'une variante de la méthode de Jefferson pour nommer des représentants à la Chambre haute. La méthode de Jefferson est un procédé des hautes moyennes, et le but de celui-ci consiste à répartir les sièges en proportion du nombre de votes, en maintenant le ratio de votes reçus aux sièges attribués aussi près que possible. Le tractl a reçu une bonne quantité de fois l'attention nationale et internationale. La publication nous donne une fenêtre d'opportunité pour tenter de réformer notre système de vote, mais nous pourrions peut-être se contenter d'un certain prestige international du fait de la publication à la place ? Quelle est la position du gouvernement ? ;Ein Professor an einer unserer angesehensten Universitäten hat ein Traktat über politische Philosophie herausgebracht. Das Traktat fordert eine Variante der Jefferson-Methode für die Ernennung von Repräsentanten ins Oberhaus. Die Jefferson-Methode ist eine Methode der höchsten Querschnittswerte, und ihr Zweck ist es, Kabinettssitze im Verhältnis zur Anzahl an Stimmen zuzuteilen, die eine bestimmte Wahlliste erreicht hat. Dies wird dadurch erreicht, dass die erzielten Stimmanzahlen proportional den zugeteilten Sitzen so genau wie möglich entsprechen. Das Traktat hat im In- und Ausland eine Menge Interesse geweckt. Die Publikation gibt uns eine Gelegenheit zur Reform unseres Wahlsystems, aber vielleicht könnten wir uns mit internationalem Prestige für die Publikation zufrieden geben? Was ist die Position der Regierung?;;Un profesor de una de nuestras más prestigiosas universidades ha publicado un tratado de filosofía política. El tratado aboga en favor de una variante del método de Jefferson para la elección de representantes para la Cámara Alta. El método Jefferson es un sistema de medias altas y su propósito es el de asignar asientos en función del número de votos que ha recibido una lista concreta de un partido, manteniendo lo más cercanos posibles el porcentaje de votos recibidos y el número de asientos. El tratado ha llamado mucho la atención tanto a nivel nacional como internacional.

EVTDESC4201;A nationwide political reform club has formed in $COUNTRY$. The club has made it its agenda to reform the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ voting system, and they have initially been able to gain a fair amount of political traction in the public debate. The club wants to see our Jeffersonian voting system replaced with one of proportional representation. The club argues that a proportional representation allows for a fairer and more balanced representation for the totality of our population, rather than for arbitrary political voting circles. With the amount of traction that the club has been able to garner, we would be hard pressed if we gave it no attention, on the other hand, reform might not be on our agenda right now.;Un club de réforme politique nationale s'est formé en $COUNTRY$. Le club a fait son ordre du jour sur la réforme du système de vote $COUNTRY_ADJ$, et ils ont d'abord été en mesure d'obtenir une bonne quantité d'attraction politique dans le débat public. Le club veut voir notre système de vote Jeffersonian remplacé par celui de la représentation proportionnelle. Le club fait valoir que la représentation proportionnelle, permet une représentation plus juste et plus équilibré pour la totalité de notre population, plutôt que par d'arbitraire cercles de vote politique. Avec la force d'attraction que le club a pu recueillir, il nous serait très difficile de ne lui prêter aucune attention sur ce point, la réforme peut-être ou pas sur notre agenda dès maintenant.;Ein landesweiter Verein für Politische Reformen wurde in $COUNTRY$ gegründet. Der Verein hat sich vorgenommen, das $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Wahlsystem zu reformieren, und sie haben anfänglich in der öffentlichen Debatte viel politischen Einfluss gelten machen können. Der Verein will unser Jeffersonsches Wahlsystem mit einem ersetzen, das auf proportionaler Repräsentation aufbaut. Der Verein argumentiert, dass proportionale Repräsentation fairer und ausgewogener für unsere Gesamtbevölkerung ist, anstatt nur einigen wenigen politischen Wählerzirkeln zu dienen. Mit dem Einfluss, den der Verein nun schon geltend macht, wären wir schlecht beraten, wenn wir der Sache keine Aufmerksamkeit schenkten. Auf der anderen Seite sind Reformen vielleicht gerade nicht auf unserem Aktionsplan.;;Se ha formado una asociación política reformista a escala nacional en $COUNTRY$. La asociación tiene el propósito de reformar el sistema de votación en $COUNTRY$ y han podido ganar una buena cantidad de apoyo político inicial en el debate público. Su intención es la sustitución de nuestro sistema Jeffersoniano por uno de representación proporcional. La asociación argumenta que el sistema proporcional permite una representación más justa y equilibrada de la totalidad de nuestra población, en lugar de tener que depender de círculos arbitrarios de votos políticos. Con la cantidad de apoyo que la asociación ha logrado reunir, nos presionarían demasiado si no le concediésemos atención alguna. Por otro lado, puede que ahora no nos convenga una reforma.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4202;With the Upper House firmly in liberal hands, our population seems to have given us a clear and unequivocal mandate for political reform. This could be a good opportunity to reform our voting system, but the question is: In which direction? With the clear mandate we have, we could choose to go in more or less any direction, and the options that seem to lie on the table are a first past the post system and a Jeffersonian method. While we will still have to drag the reforms through our legislative bodies, this could be a good opportunity to build momentum.;Avec la Chambre haute fermement en des mains libérales, notre population semble avoir donné un mandat clair et sans équivoque pour la réforme politique.

Despite certain radicals, the movement for charter reform is still largely keeping itself within the bounds of peaceful protest.

EVTDESC4301;Our voting system is heavily based on and around the ownership of land. A case has gained some notoriety in one of our states, where a young widow has been denied the voting rights tied to her estate, on account of the estate quickly losing market value due to falling prices in the area. The event has led to a wider discussion on the landed voting system in general, and several reform minded ideas are circulating in intellectual and progressive circles. The issue on the table is what stance the government should take on the case's principal issue. Should we attempt to fix voting indexes, and anger the poor strata of the local population, or allow them to fluctuate?;Notre système électoral est fortement basée sur et autour de la propriété des terres. Un cas a acquis une certaine notoriété dans l'un de nos Etats, où une jeune veuve s'est vu refusée les droits de vote attachés à sa propriété, pour la raison que la succession pouvait rapidement perdre de la valeur en raison de la baisse des prix dans la zone.

Der Fall hat zu einer breiteren Diskussion über das Grundbesitzwahlrecht im Allgemeinen geführt, und eine Reihe von Reformideen zirkulieren nun in den Kreisen der Intellektuellen und Progressiven. Es geht darum, welche Position die Regierung zu diesem Fall einnehmen soll.

EVTDESC4302;Suffrage in $COUNTRY$ is directly based on the ownership of wealth and property. The fundamental principle is that only those who contribute to the common good should have a say in how that public good is managed and administered. One interesting consequence of this system has surfaced in one of our states, where several local merchants and traders from the middle classes have started earning enough to be allowed representation. Adjusting the rules will be seen as an adjustment to exclude certain social classes, and will not be appreciated by the richer classes. Disenfranchising the newly enfranchised middle classes risks a sharp rise in local militancy.;Le suffrage en $COUNTRY$ est directement fondé sur la propriété des richesses et des biens. Le principe fondamental est que seuls ceux qui contribuent au bien commun doivent avoir mot à dire dans la façon de gérer le bien public. Une conséquence intéressante de ce système est apparu dans un de nos Etats, où plusieurs commerçants locaux et les commerçants de la classe moyenne ont commencé à gagner suffisamment pour être représentés. Un remaniement de la réglementation sera considéré comme un ajustement afin d'exclure certaines classes sociales, et ne sera pas apprécié par les classes riches. Mais priver de leurs droits les classes nouvellement affranchies, c'est risqué une forte hausse du militantisme local...;Das Wahlrecht in $COUNTRY$ basiert direkt auf den Besitz von Geld und Gütern. Das fundamentale Prinzip ist, dass nur Menschen, die zum Allgemeinwohl beitragen, das Recht zur Mitsprache bei der Verwaltung öffentlicher Güter haben. Eine interessante Konsequenz dieses Systems ist in einem unserer Staaten aufgetreten, wo mehrere lokale Händler und Kaufleute aus der Mittelklasse nun genug verdienen, um in den Genuss von Repräsentation zu kommen. Eine Anpassung der Regeln würde als Versuch angesehen, gewisse soziale Klassen außen vor zu halten und nicht die Zustimmung der reichen Klassen finden. Denen das Wahlrecht zu entziehen, die es gerade erst erworben haben, wird die lokale Militanz um Einiges steigern.;;En $COUNTRY$, el voto se basa directamente en la posesión de riqueza y propiedades. El principio fundamental es el de que solo aquellos que contribuyen al bien común deben tener algo que decir en la manera en que se gestiona y administra ese bien público. Una consecuencia interesante de este sistema ha aparecido en uno de nuestros estados, en el que varios comerciantes locales de la clase media han empezado a ganar lo suficiente como para obtener representación. Ajustar las reglas se verá como un intento de excluir a determinadas clases sociales, cosa que no gustará a las clases más ricas.

EVTDESC4423;The Censorship Bureau has found itself swamped with work in the past few years, and the executive director of the bureau has complained on numerous occasions that his subordinates are incapable of keeping up with the constantly increasing amount of material coming in for review. The issue of the overworked bureau has now reached critical mass with the publication of an article expressing slanderous anti-government propaganda, bordering on personal libel directed at several cabinet members. When asked how the newspaper could pass the censorship process, The Censorship Bureau has pointed to several old reports detailing it's lack of resources. Several cabinet members, however, claim that the bureau has more than enough resources to handle the tasks assigned to it, and that the problems are fundamentally organizational.;Le bureau de la censure s'est trouvé déborder de travail au cours de ces dernières années, et le directeur général du bureau s'est plaint à de nombreuses reprises que ses subordonnés soient incapables de suivre la quantité sans cesse croissante de matières à examiner.

Lorsqu'on lui a demandé comment le journal pourrait passer le processus de la censure, Le bureau de la censure a rappelé plusieurs vieux rapports détaillant son manque de ressources. Des ministres, cependant, prétendent que le bureau a plus qu'assez de ressources pour gérer les tâches qui lui sont assignées, et que les problèmes sont fondamentalement organisationnelles. ;Das Zensuramt ist in den letzten paar Jahren mit Arbeit überschwemmt worden, und der Direktor des Amtes hat sich mehrfach beschwert, dass seine Untergebenen nicht mit dem konstant wachsenden Berg an zu bearbeitendem Material Schritt halten können. Das Problem des überarbeiteten Zensuramts ist nun an den Siedepunkt gelangt mit der Veröffentlichung eines Artikels, der verleumdende Propaganda gegen die Regierung enthält, die an persönliche Angriffe auf mehrere Kabinettsmitglieder grenzt. Auf die Frage, wie das Zensuramt diesen Zeitungsartikel durchlassen konnte, verwies das Amt auf mehrere alte Berichte, die seinen Ressourcenmangel beklagen. Mehrere Kabinettmitglieder aber behaupten, dass mehr als genug Ressourcen vorhanden sind, und dass das Problem eigentlich ein organisatorisches ist.;;El departamento de censura lleva desbordado de trabajo desde los últimos años y el director jefe del mismo ya se ha quejado en numerosas ocasiones de que sus subordinados son incapaces de mantener el ritmo con la gran cantidad de nuevo material que llega para su revisión.

Cuando se les preguntó cómo había logrado eludir el periódico el filtro de la censura, el departamento señaló que ya habían redactado numerosos informes acerca de su falta de recursos. Sin embargo, varios miembros del Gabinete opinan que el departamento tiene recursos de sobra para manejar las tareas asignadas y que los problemas son, principalmente, de tipo organizativo.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4425;One has to wonder what went through their minds. To publish a text like this in a country like $COUNTRY$? In any event, what is done is done. A widely circulated $COUNTRY_ADJ$ daily has published a blasphemous text containing a scathing denunciation of all things religious. The text is written by a member of our intelligentsia of some renown, and is perhaps a sign of the godless times we live in. Moralists demand that the text be retracted with a formal apology issued to the offended religious institutions, while several members of the reform-minded elites argue that the author was simply exercising his right to free speech. After all, the press is free in $COUNTRY$, so there is a case to be made.;On peut se demander ce qui se passait dans leurs têtes, pour publier un texte comme celui-ci dans un pays comme $COUNTRY$ ?

Le texte est écrit par un membre de notre intelligencia d'une certaine renommée, et c'est peut-être un signe des temps sans Dieu dans lesquels nous vivons. Les moralistes demandent que le texte soit retiré avec des excuses officielles délivrées aux institutions religieuses offensées, tandis que plusieurs membres des élites réformatrices font valoir que l'auteur a simplement excercé son droit à la liberté d'expression.

Der Text wurde von einem bekannten Mitglied unserer Intelligenzia geschrieben und ist vermutlich ein Zeichen der gottlosen Zeiten, in denen wir leben. Moralisten verlangen, dass der Text mit einer formellen Entschuldigung an die beleidigten religiösen Institutionen zurückgezogen wird, während mehrere Mitglieder der reformbewussten Eliten argumentieren, dass der Autor nur sein Recht auf freie Meinung in Anspruch genommen hat. Schließlich hat $COUNTRY$ eine freie Presse.;;Uno no puede evitar preguntarse qué les pasó por la cabeza. ¿Publicar un texto como este en un país como $COUNTRY$?

El texto está escrito por un miembro de nuestra intelectualidad de cierto renombre y puede que sea una señal de los tiempos impíos que nos toca vivir.

EVTDESC44300;After the Conservative administration had been voted into majority in Parliament in 1872, charges were levied against John A. Macdonald of the most serious nature. Macdonald’s pet project had been the trans-continental railway, and the Liberal administration charged that Sir Hugh Allan had given him campaign funds in exchange for a guaranteed contract with his company, Canadian Pacific. Despite Macdonald’s claims of innocence, he was forced to resign as Prime Minister. Donald A.

EVTDESC44301;The Métis people were a group of small communities of French-Indian blood in the Manitoba region who had hopes of self-government. Unfortunately their dreams were shattered when the Hudson's Bay land, which they were a part of, were given to Canada without their consent. In protest the Métis people, led by Louis Riel, revolted. Louis Riel was a highly religious man, who had studied for the clergy in his earlier life. He fought for the Métis people and became a hero in the eyes of Manitobans. Louis bargained with the Canadian government for Manitoba's entry into Confederation. Canadian delegates guaranteed the rights of the people would be respected. Thus, Manitoba, the postage-stamp province, was born.;Le peuple métis était un groupe de petites communautés de sang franco-indien dans la région du Manitoba qui avait l'espoir d'une accession à l'autonomie gouvernementale. Malheureusement, leurs rêves ont été anéantis quand la terre de la baie d'Hudson, dont ils faisaient partie, a été donnée au Canada sans leur consentement. En signe de protestation le peuple métis, conduit par Louis Riel, s'est révolté. Louis Riel était un homme très religieux, qui avait étudié pour le clergé dans une vie antérieure. Il a combattu pour le peuple Métis et est devenu un héros aux yeux de la population manitobaine. Louis a négocié avec le gouvernement canadien pour l'entrée du Manitoba dans la Confédération. Les délégués canadiens ont garanti que les droits du peuple seraient respectés. Ainsi, le Manitoba, une province 'timbre-poste', est né. ;Die Métis waren eine kleine Gruppe französisch-indianischer Mischlinge in der Manitoba-Region, die sich Hoffnungen auf Selbstverwaltung machten. Unglücklicherweise wurden diese Träume zerstört, als das Gebiet um die Hudson Bay ohne ihre Zustimmung an Kanada abgetreten wurde. Unter der Führung von Louis Riel erhoben sich die Métis dagegen. Louis Riel war ein tief religiöser Mann, der sich in seiner Jugend auf das Priesteramt vorbereitet hatte. Er kämpfte für die Métis und wurde dadurch in den Augen vieler Einwohner Manitobas zum Helden. Er verhandelte mit der kanadischen Regierung über einen Eintritt Manitobas in die Föderation. Die kanadischen Delegierten garantierten, die Respektierung der Rechte der Métis. Dies war die Geburtsstunde der Briefmarkenprovinz Manitoba.;Louis Riel y la primera rebelión de los mestizos;Los mestizos eran una agrupación de pequeñas comunidades de ascendencia mixta francesa e india de la región de Manitoba que tenían esperanzas de autogobierno. Por desgracia, sus sueños se vinieron abajo cuando el territorio de la Bahía de Hudson del que formaban parte fue entregado a Canadá sin su consentimiento. Como protesta, los mestizos se sublevaron al mando de Louis Riel. Louis Riel era un hombre profundamente religioso que estudió para sacerdote en su juventud. Luchó por los mestizos y fue considerado un héroe a ojos de la gente de Manitoba. Louis negoció con el gobierno canadiense el ingreso de Manitoba en la confederación. Los delegados canadienses aseguraron que se respetarían los derechos de la gente. De este modo nació la provincia de Manitoba.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44302;Although the Canadian government promised to respect the rights of the Métis, it did not appear to do so. Métis petitions for recognition of their land-holdings and institutions went unheeded. The Métis also became increasingly upset with the growing numbers of settlers from the east, invading their territories. In early 1885, the situation came to a head when the Métis once again took up arms in revolt. Adopting the Revolutionary Bill of Rights, the Métis established their own government and independence from Canada. Canadian troops came and crushed the rebellion. Louis Riel was tried and executed. The Métis would not be recognized officially as a people until a hundred years later.;Bien que le gouvernement canadien a promis de respecter les droits des Métis, il ne semble pas vouloir le faire. Des pétitions pour la reconnaissance de leurs biens fonciers et des institutions Métis, sont restées lettre morte. Les Métis sont aussi de plus en plus contrariés par le nombre croissant de colons de l'Est, qui envahissent leur territoire. Au début de 1885, la situation a atteint son paroxysme lorsque les Métis ont, de nouveau, pris les armes en se révoltant. Adoptant un projet de loi révolutionnaire, ils ont établi leur propre gouvernement et déclarés leur indépendance du Canada. Les troupes canadiennes sont alors intervenues et ont écrasé la rébellion. Louis Riel a été jugé et exécuté. Les Métis ne seront officiellement reconnus comme un peuple que cent ans après. ;Obwohl die kanadische Regierung versprochen hatte, die Rechte der Métis zu respektieren, schien dies nicht den Tatsachen zu entsprechen. Die Petitionen der Métis für die Anerkennung ihres Grundbesitzes wurden nicht beachtet. Die Métis wurde zudem durch die steigende Zahl von Siedlern beunruhigt, die in ihr Territorium einfielen. Anfang 1885 eskalierte die Situation, als sich die Métis erneut in einem bewaffneten Aufstand erhoben. Sie übernahmen die revolutionäre 'Bill of Rights', errichten eine eigene Regierung und erklärten ihre Unabhängigkeit von Kanada. Die Rebellion wurde schließlich von kanadischen Truppen niedergeschlagen. Louis Riel wurde vor Gericht gestellt und hingerichtet. Es sollte weitere hundert Jahre dauern, bis die Métis offiziell als Volk anerkannt wurden.;La rebelión del noroeste;Aunque el gobierno canadiense prometió respetar los derechos de los mestizos, no parece que fuera así. Las peticiones de los mestizos de que sus posesiones e instituciones fuesen reconocidas se desoyeron. Los mestizos también se sentían cada vez más disgustados ante la invasión de sus territorios por un creciente número de colonos procedentes del este. A principios de 1885, la situación estalló cuando los mestizos volvieron a tomar las armas y se rebelaron. Adoptando el 'Proyecto de ley revolucionario', los mestizos establecieron su propio gobierno, independizándose de Canadá. La rebelión fue aplastada por las tropas canadienses. Louis Riel fue juzgado y ejecutado. Los mestizos tardarían cien años en ser reconocidos oficialmente como pueblo.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC44830;Emperor Maximilian has never enjoyed popular support in Mexico, and now that insurgents led by Benito Juárez have captured him it seems his reign has come to an end.

EVTDESC44835;Porfirio Díaz, General of Mexico and considered a hero by some, has overthrown the democratic government of Mexico in a military coup.

EVTDESC44840;In a surprise development, the leader of Mexico-- General Antonio de Santa Anna himself-- has been captured. Found running through the countryside, attempting to escape back to Mexico, he has been imprisoned in a Texan jail and forced to negotiate. We can force the man to agree to a peace treaty-- even though many consider the odds of Santa Anna's own country agreeing to terms exacted under duress to be slight, it may be our only hope against overwhelming odds. At the very least, the humiliation dealt against their leader will be a blow against the Mexican government and one from which they will not soon recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44841;In a humiliating blow to Mexico's prestige, General Santa Anna has been captured within Texan territory-- separated from our army and found wandering the countryside in an attempt to return to Mexico. While imprisoned, he agreed to a series of treaties which recognized Texan independence among other guarantees... all in exchange for his safe return. We are now faced with a question: while the treaties are worthless, disregarding them completely could give the Americans a cause to intervene. Either way, one thing is certain: as the architect of this fiasco, Santa Anna's time in power is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44842;While Mexico had every reason to refute the treaties signed by Santa Anna, it seems their willingness to continue the war against Texas has waned.

EVTDESC44843;As expected, the Mexican government has refuted the Treaties of Velasco and refused to negotiate for Santa Anna's return.

How long it will last is unknown, but for the moment Texas has its respite.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44845;Despite the assurances supposedly offered by the Treaties of Velasco, we once again find ourselves at war with Mexico. The ceasefire is, it seems, now over. While many in our government never expected Mexico to live up to the terms of the treaties anyhow, they do suggest that this might be enough cause for the Americans to intervene. Such an intervention would, of course, be inviting the wolves through the front door. but do we have any other choice?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It seems like shaky grounds. but do we turn our backs on them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800102;Our efforts to incite $COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots in $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been discovered. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is threatening war over this breach of their sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;
EVTDESC800110;Several ministers have suggested that the royal heir is old enough to be married. They suggest seeking out a suitable candidate from among the royalty of $COUNTRY$'s neighbors.

EVTDESC800111;Several ministers have suggested that one of the royal heirs is old enough to be married. Though it would be better to seek out a candidate from the royal families of neighboring countries, the ministers have concluded that there is no-one suitable.

EVTDESC800115;There has been some open questioning of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy, with some citizens apparently believing the time has come to move to a more democratic form of government. Members of the aristocracy have been upset by this talk, and have been calling on the government to crack down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800116;Those opposed to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy have started printing an underground newspaper in one of our provinces, spreading revolutionary ideas with headlines like 'The Monarchy Must End!'. They will be difficult to uproot, yet if we do not do so we will be faced with even more conflict down the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8001160;It seems our policy of allowing the newspapers to speak as they wish is now coming to haunt us. Recently, a prominent newspaper in one of our provinces has published a high-profile article criticising the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy. If we do nothing, this talk will spread. Yet our only other option is to restrict the freedom of the press entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800117;A massive demonstration has taken place in $CAPITAL$, calling on the government to provide more freedom to the masses. If we appease them with promises of reform, we will very soon have to deal with the repercussions of not carrying through with our promise.

EVTDESC800121;There has been increasing question as of late as to the amount of power the monarchy has in $COUNTRY$. Many prominent citizens have been speaking out publicly in favor of allowing different parties to partake in the government and provide alternate points of view.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;
EVTDESC800122;Word has reached the royal council that a number of prominent citizens are clamoring for greater freedom to vote. There are, however, still others who believe the monarchy has extended too many freedoms as it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800123;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocracy has never been in favor of change, and with the rise of liberal attitudes there are those in elite circles who feel that something needs to be done. A cabal of old guard aristocrats has formed, with the reported goal of ensuring that traditional values be maintained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800147;The Indian subcontinent has been overwhelmed by the Sepoy rebels. Our garrisons are in retreat, and our colonial governors have already fled for safer ports. We have no choice but to give into their demands, many of which involve removing $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence from any of the nations we have subjugated over the years of our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800148;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ presence in South Asia has finally come to an end. With $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ governors fleeing the subcontinent in droves, our nation suddenly has a chance to regain lost lands and obtain our freedom ...whether we wish it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC800149;After a swarm of violence and looting that engulfed the entire nation, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rioters have stormed the capital. The government has been forced to make numerous concessions, in a desperate bid to calm the people. So far it seems to have worked, and has spared many leaders from being executed by angry mobs, but it remains to be seen whether these concessions will only cause more problems in the end than they solved.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800150;Pan-nationalist rebels demanding a greater $UNION_ADJ$ union have taken over $CAPITAL$, and have begun spreading the idea of $COUNTRY$ becoming part of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ no matter the cost to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC800151;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots have risen up in a neighboring country, and have gained sufficient control that they have sent word they wish to bring the province back to $COUNTRY$.

EVTDESC80103;The Amban, our Imperial representative from Peking and effectively the governor of $COUNTRY$, has informed our government that $FROMCOUNTRY$ has concluded a treaty with Russia-- a treaty that includes portions of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory, with now must be handed over without comment.

EVTDESC80110;A diplomat from Russia has arrived in $COUNTRY$ with an infuriating demand: they wish to readjust the borders on our northeastern frontier, agreed upon almost two hundred years ago. They wish access to a southern port upon the Sea of Japan, meaning all of Haishenwai would be turned over to them. Any $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$-claimed territory would be handed over by us and our vassals. This is surely a wicked threat, capitalizing on our current perceived weakness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80111;Now that the rebellion in distant Xinjiang is finished, there appears to be some question as to who has ownership over the Dungan basin. The western half of the basin, in Qaratal, is occupied by the wicked Russians. but they wish control over the eastern half in Ili, as well. Should we surrender the basin peacefully, or fight for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ honor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80115;$COUNTRY$ is a nation hovering between two powers that could crush us without thought. A Russian diplomat has arrived in $CAPITAL$, offering us protection in return for our fealty.

EVTDESC810056;Cheering crowds in $CAPITAL$ are celebrating the toppling of the old $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, now replaced by a new and socialist order dedicated to social reform within all levels of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government.

EVTDESC85000;There has been increasing violence against French missionaries in Korea, recently culminating in the execution of Bishop Siméon-François Berneux-- head of the fledgling Korean Catholic Church-- and the subsequent killing of almost all priests in the country as well as thousands of Catholic Koreans. One surviving priest fled to the Qing Empire, relaying his tale to a French war vessal which then launched a punitive expedition with the support of the French consul in Beijing. There is a call for France to go to war against Korea-- but this is complicated by the fact that Korea is a tributary state of the Qing. If we press the matter, we risk war with the Koreans' master, but if we back down it will be a great blow to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85001;The foolish Koreans have begun executing Catholics within their territory, and this has included a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ missionaries-- and now the French have demanded retribution. The problem, naturally, is that Korea is a Qing tributary. We are obligated to come to the Korean's defense, even if this means war with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Of course, there are those who say the Koreans have brought this on themselves. We would lose little sleep if we left them to their own devices, and earn favor with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85002;One of our rulers has executed a group of French missionaries, resulting in French outrage and a punitive expedition against $COUNTRY$-- which should have brought our Qing allies to our defense. Frustratingly, and perhaps not unexpectedly, the Qing have responded by severing their ties to $COUNTRY$ and abandoning us to our fate. War with the French seems likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85003;Not unexpectedly, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to abandon Korea to its fate in order to curry favor with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85004;One of our rulers has executed a group of French missionaries, resulting in French outrage and a punitive expedition against $COUNTRY$-- which has brought our Qing allies to bear.

EVTDESC85010;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the Korean coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal Korean fortress. In a fury, our ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle the Koreans on land. After victory, they returned home-- but word of the assault has spread. This is yet another example of Korea flaunting its disrect for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authority. Many within the government are suggesting we demand not only an apology, but force a treaty upon the Koreans which will see their nation forced to open itself to our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85011;A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal fortress-- who assumed the vessel to be an enemy. In a fury, their ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle our forces on land. They returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ delegation has arrived in $CAPITAL$ to demand compensation-- in the form of an unequal treaty requiring $COUNTRY$ be opened to their influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85012;A Japanese vessel, surveying the Korean coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal fortress-- who assumed the vessel to be an enemy. In a fury, the Japanese ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle Korean forces on land. The Japanese returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now we hear tale that they have forced the Koreans to sign an unequal treaty in consequence... one which has forced them to sever tributary ties to $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85015;We are being overwhelmed by the superior might of Japanese armaments. Despite the loss of face, we must consider offering the hated Japanese terms of our surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85020;With increasing frustration against government corruption and foreign influence in $COUNTRY$, a rebel movement has appeared among followers of the Tonghak or 'Eastern Learning' ideology. They have been stirring up the peasant classes, forming poorly-armed if numerous armies to purge the capital and rid the country of Japanese and other foreign presence. We will need to move quickly if we wish to prevent them from overthrowing the government or causing an incident with neighbouring powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85021;The unrest caused by the Tonghak movement appears to be coming to an end. The militant leaders have vanished into the countryside, and their followers have dispersed. Order is restored-- for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85025;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has received reports of a massive rebellion forming in Korea, serious enough that several members of the Korean government have sent an urgent call to $COUNTRY$ to intervene. Any forces we dispatch will likely provoke a response from Japan, who will fear that we are attempting to uproot their influence. This may, however, be an opportunity for $COUNTRY$ to solidify our own influence in Korea-- many advisors are saying that we cannot allow the potential response from Japan stop us from acting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85026;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has moved to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion currently underway in Korea. It seems likely that, should $FROMCOUNTRY$ succeed in quelling the rebellion, they will become the unquestioned masters of Korea and all but eliminate what influence we possess there. The only sensible move is to send in forces to overthrow the Korean government and replace it with one that is more firmly pro-Japanese-- despite the conflict this will all but certainly spark with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85027;Reacting to reports that the Chinese are planning to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered $CAPITAL$ and captured the Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. Pro-Japanese supporters have been installed in the new government, effectively rendering us a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal. Both rebels and loyalist forces throughout the country have reacted in rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85028;Responding to news of our intended intervention, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered Seoul and captured the Korean Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. A pro-Japanese government has been installed, effectively rendering Korea a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal, with orders to end any agreements and alliances with $COUNTRY$ and ban our forces from entering their nation. This is, of course, an insult of the highest magnitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85029;Reacting to the Tonghak uprising, the Chinese have moved forces into Korea-- entering $CAPITAL$ and effectively setting up a government under their complete control in a swift coup. That there has been no reaction from the Japanese government is surprising, just as it is frustrating that our embattled armies have had no chance to agree to this so-called 'help' from the Chinese. Either way, rebels and loyalists alike are enraged at this foreign intrusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85030;The rebellion in Korea has grown worse, and already we have reports of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ consulate under assault by rebel forces. It seems the Korean government is helpless. Considering that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ stands by doing nothing, refusing Korean appeals for help, it seems we are in a position to act-- some are suggesting that we engineer a pro-Japanese coup in Seoul to install a government more firmly in our control, and prevent any possibility of an overthrow eliminating our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC90050;The duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have long been united and considered indivisible under the Danish crown, but a question of royal claim to the duchies combined with the Holsteinian desire to join in the larger German Confederation to the south has led to considerable difficulty for King Frederick VII.

If we defy the Congress, however, we could be facing war from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC90075;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now it has become all too apparent, and a threat to the vision of the Ottoman Empire as master of the Orient... something which has been little more than an illusion, but which the Ottomans must either address or have it shattered forever. War will come, and Egypt will either be beaten back into place and made to heel at its master's side or seek its own destiny as a power in its own right. Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90076;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now that independence has become all too apparent, and Ottoman mastery over the Orient is threatened. Either we must take steps to rectify the situation, and assert our dominance once and for all, or admit to the world that our power is little more than an illusion. There are those who feel that a peaceful solution is possible, and that the Egyptians might better serve as powerful allies than as implacable enemies, but that would require us to surrender our claim to Egyptian lands as well as be an affront to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90077;While we expected immediate Ottoman reprisal, it seems our former overlords are willing to negotiate. Their proposal is as follows: split the Levant between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, allow Ottoman influence to remain and they will permit our independence. Of course, while this would retain an alliance with the Empire it seems like many to hardly be true independence at all. Still, it would avoid a great deal of bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90078;Our negotiations have been successful: Egypt has agreed to partition the Levant, and we retain influence within their territory. While this spares us a great deal of bloodshed (and the possibility of an embarassing defeat), it does mean we have lost control over the Christian Holy Land in Palestine-- something that will not go over well with the powers of the world, and with Russia in particular.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90079;Despite our willingness to negotiate, Egypt has refused to accept any Ottoman influence in their territory... and also refuses to give up control over any of the Levant. We have no choice but to take it from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC90080;The Turks have proven unable to retake the Levant from us, despite all the assistance they have received from the rest of Europe. Even those great powers must now admit that the Levant rightfully belongs to us, and that the 'Sick Man of Europe' has no claim over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90081;Egypt has been defeated, and the so-called Oriental Crisis brought to an end with the Ottoman Empire unquestionably the victor. The question now arises as to what should be done with them. There are those who argue that attempting to assume direct control over Egyptian lands would be folly, and that instead we should assume control over the Levant and any lands we have direct claim to... but keep them in our sphere of influence. Others say this only begs for a repeat of the crisis we just faced. They say that Egypt must be turned into an Ottoman colony, rebellions or no.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90082;A recent Misri uprising in $PROVINCENAME$ was put down harshly by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces, but the unrest has spread throughout all of $STATENAME$. They are resisting the direct rule of Egypt by $COUNTRY$, and we should expect further problems here in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90083;Still stinging from their defeat at the hands of the Ottomans, the Egyptian aristocracy has focused the blame on the rapid westernization of the nation and the instability they claim it has brought. They are demanding that the government cling more strongly to tradition and repeal some of these reforms, and there are fears that if they are not satisified they may instigate a revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90084;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has declared that it will not accept Egyptian surrender, and has rejected terms that the rest of Europe feels are quite fair-- instead pushing onwards to recapture all of Egypt. There are many within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government who feel this is a betrayal... $COUNTRY$ intervened to help maintain $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from collapsing, but perhaps they do not need our help at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90085;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Should the Egyptians successfully challenge Ottoman rule, it could upset the entire balance of power in the region... something that many feel would threaten $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests. Still others believe that $COUNTRY$ must remain neutral, despite the cost to our relations with the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90086;We have received word through the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ embassy pledging their support for the Ottoman Empire in our conflict with the Egyptians. This is heartening news.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;
EVTDESC90087;Our forces are on the run. It seems the hated Ottomans and their allies have won the day, and we have little choice but to submit to their demands. We can try to hold out and turn the tide, but it is far more likely that Egypt will simply be carved up into pieces by the imperialists if we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90088;The Egyptians have raised the white flag, offering to abide by the Convention of London and return both Crete and the majority of the Levant to our control. Our advisors say that wresting control of the entire country is almost impossible, and that we should take the offer while we can and let the Egyptians go.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90089;The Egyptians have surrendered to $FROMCOUNTRY$ and agreed to abide by the terms of the London Convention. Stability has been restored to the Orient... for now. All that remains is for us to decide whether to end hostilities with the Egyptians and return any $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ lands that we hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;
EVTDESC90090;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Egyptian diplomats have contacted ours through channels, and suggested that support in its war would be appreciated and rewarded. The Ottomans, they rightfully point out, are after all no friends of $COUNTRY$. Such an act could earn us the enmity of the Empire and its allies, however, and thus feel we must remain neutral in the conflict despite the possible benefit to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90091;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If something isn't done it could develop into an alliance between Egypt and $FROMCOUNTRY$ that could lead to their intervention in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;
EVTDESC90092;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If we do not object now, that support could lead to their intervention in the war. That objection, however, could also be seen as aggression on our part and harm our relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90093;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have sent a demand through diplomatic channels that we back down from our support of the Egyptians. Doing so will harm the influence we have gained in Egypt, but if we do nothing we risk retaliation from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC90094;Egypt has fallen, settling matters with the Turks through a peace treaty which has seen the Levant taken from them and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in Egypt vastly reduced.

Remember the Maine!\n\nA riot by Cuban Spanish loyalists recently broke out in Havana, leading to the destruction of the printing presses of four local newspapers which criticized the Spanish Army. The battleship USS Maine was sent to Havana in response to fears expressed by the American consulate that Americans in Cuba might be endangered. Not long after arriving, the Maine was rocked by an explosion, killing 268 of the crew and sinking the ship in the harbour. American newspapers have leapt on the event, painting pictures of Spanish atrocities which have whipped up the public into a rage.

EVTDESC90120;Three Filipino priests have been executed in the Manila, charged with subversion. While the executions are said to have been just, they are now considered martyrs by the Filipino people and have inspired the creation of a literary and organization known as 'the Propaganda Movement'.

EVTDESC95276;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Dakota Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC95277;'We have been the subjects of despots in Mexico as well as cruel tyrants in Washington, and we stand here before you today to declare that we will stand for neither. Ours is a unique heritage, and we will move forward with the intention of celebrating it in the spirit of freedom and goodwill for all mankind.'/n/nWith these words, a group of delegates gathered in Phoenix have declared the formation of a 'Pueblo Republic'. Arizona and New Mexico have both seceded from the union to form it, daring us to stop their rebellion-- if we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95278;'Our path lies in a different direction-- with our hearts, our faith, and our integrity. May God watch over us and keep us safe in this perilous world.'/n/nWith these words, the leader of the Mormons has declared the formation of the independent nation of Deseret, encompassing both Utah and Nevada. They stand ready to resist any attempt by us to retake them through force.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95279;'Our joining of the Union was with the understanding that it meant something-- we were joining a cause for true freedom in a world full of totalitarianism, a cause far greater than any we could hope to achieve on our own. We were mistaken, and now we must march forward on our own terms. May God help us all.'/n/nWith these words, the governor of California met with a large number of delegates in San Francisco and declared their state seceded from the Union-- to the widespread support of many Californians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95280;'We are the Lone Star State. We fought against the Mexicans and succeeded, and now we shall fight against the Yankees if they come. Let them come. Texas bows before no-one.'/n/nWith these words, the governor of Texas stood before a group of gathered delegates and declared their state seceded from the Union. Already an army of supporters is gathering in Austin, ready to fight against any reprisal from Washington.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95281;'We stand here in Boston, the birthplace of this nation and the home of the Liberty Bell. Let the bell ring, let it announce to the world that our beloved homeland has fallen from grace. It is up to the Sons of Liberty to rise in its place, to fight for truth and freedom wherever its meaning has been lost. We will brook no tyrants in America.'/n/nWith these words, a group of delegates from throughout New England have declared their states seceded from the Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95282;'We are the true North, the furthest frontier of the United States. We are a sturdy people who will stand on our own when called to-- and that call goes out to you now. Alaska never sought its independence, but it will stand for what's right. God help us all.'/n/nWith these words, the governor of Alaska spoke to delegates gathered at Stika and announced that the state-- cut off from support by the rest of the nation-- was forced to stand on its own. Whether the state intends to one day rejoin the Union if that situation changes is currently unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95283;'Once we were a nation of our own, but we joined with the United States and have earned our place in the Union. We are a hard-working people who will do whatever must be done-- and now we must act. Hawaii never sought its independence, but it will stand for what's right. God help us all.'/n/nWith these words, the governor of Hawaii spoke to delegates gathered at Honolulu and announced that the state-- cut off from support by the rest of the nation-- was forced to stand on its own.

EVTDESC95315;With things in $COUNTRY$ so difficult, some citizens have brought up the possibility of joining the Confederation of Canada. It is a land of freedom, and together we will be more powerful than we are separately. Shall we approach their government?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95316;A delegate from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has quietly approached the Canadian government, asking for the former American state to be admitted to Confederation.

EVTDESC95500;The colonial powers of the world have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in Africa. The outcome has become known as the 'General Act of the $CAPITAL$ Conference', formalizing the scramble for the African continent. After this point, any civilized country will largely be seen as justified in aggression towards uncivilized African nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95501;A conference has been held in $FROMCOUNTRY$, attended by all colonial powers, to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in Africa. A general agreement has been reached, formalizing the scramble for the African continent. After this point, any civilized country will largely be seen as justified in aggression towards uncivilized African nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95502;Word has reached $COUNTRY$ of a great meeting of colonial powers in Europe, wherein it was decided that African nations would be divided up amongst them-- as if our people were little more than children's toys discarded and left waiting to be picked up. This has caused a great deal of concern among those of our people with the knowledge to understand what this means. For others it has brought little more than resentment, as well as vows to fight for our independence when the day comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95503;'We have seen the outsiders. They come, with guns and riches we have never seen before. What they also bring is death, and we must always be wary what lies behind their smiles.'\n\n$COUNTRY$ stands on good terms with much of the western world, but our leaders are all too aware how quickly that could change. The Europeans believe we are not civilized, and the tone of our contact with them is slowly changing from friendly interest in trade to a strange paternalism coupled with cultural superiority. For now, $COUNTRY$ survives... but we must watch for the moment when the civilized nations decide our enslavement is the only way we can be 'saved'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95504;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ muslims are calling for the Jihad to continue: all Islamic states of the Sahel, united under one flag!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC95505;European presence in $COUNTRY$ is felt everywhere. Their traders come to $CAPITAL$ and dictate to our own merchants how trade will commence. They take what they want and pay what they wish. They tell our government what laws we may pass, and even when they do not we must always consider how they will react to what we do. If $COUNTRY$ does not act now, they will turn our nation into a colony under our very noses-- but perhaps that has already happened, and we must resign ourselves to their protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95506;Our presence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached the point where $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence is felt in every level of their society. They are a protectorate in all but name, and the time has come for us to determine whether that status should be made official. Shall we agree to make $FROMCOUNTRY$ a protectorate and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colony, or support their independence as a friendly ally?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95507;A disturbing report has reached us of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals being expelled from $FROMCOUNTRY$. Indeed, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has systematically eliminated our influence-- meaning we are in a position where we must either accept the humiliation of being thrown out of an uncivilized country or step in and assert our authority. There are some who say this is a golden opportunity to establish a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ protectorate, while others say $FROMCOUNTRY$ is simply not worth the trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95508;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ shipping company has come into the ownership of the Red Sea port of Assab, sold to them by a local Afar sultan. The port would make for an excellent coaling station, and perhaps even provide a base for $COUNTRY$ to expand our influence in the area. Pushing for more direct control, however, could cause tensions with Assab's owner-- who might feel they have greater right to the port than the sultan.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95509;The Red Sea port of Assab has been sold to $FROMCOUNTRY$ by the local Afar sultan. They have begun to use the port as a coaling station, and fears within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are that they will use this base to expand their influence within $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC95510;With the Sudan in chaos, the Ethiopians have taken advantage of the situation to regain control over the Eritrean coastlands. Though we may yet regain control over the Sudan, we should consider whether the Eritreans must be punished for this trespass.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95512;The 'Age of Princes' is upon us. The rulers of Ethiopia must struggle to unite the land under a single Emperor-- and now it is $COUNTRY$'s time to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;
EVTDESC95514;Now that Imperial rule has been restored, we must endeavour to spread control over lands that neighbour our own but which are rightfully part of our Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC95610;Advisors to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the Russians will continue their southward expansion. If we do not press north from India, we will soon find the Russians on our doorstep... And, at that point, it will be a quick step for them to invade the British Raj directly. Steps must be taken to set up puppet governments between us and them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95611;Advisors to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the British will continue their northward expansion. If we do not press south, Russia will soon have its southern borders exposed to European invasion. It does us no good to allow the British complete hegemony over Central Asia. Something must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC95612;The Great Game between the British Empire and Russia has one pushing ever northward and the other pushing ever southward, with $COUNTRY$ caught in-between. Recently, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers got into a skirmish with one of our neighbours... and the resulting incident has brought the infernal gaze of one of these powers upon us, perhaps meaning war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95613;Thanks to the Great Game and its maneuvering, tensions with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been rising. Recently, an incident occurred near their border where several $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers were attacked by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers. There were several deaths, and while the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is apologetic there are those within $COUNTRY$ who are calling for us to move in and assume control of their government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95614;It seems that $FROMCOUNTRY$ is content to accept the incident was not our intent and turn its attentions elsewhere. For the moment, $COUNTRY$ is safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC95616;Unrest within $FROMCOUNTRY$ against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule has reached a boiling point, and it appears the only solution is to step in and rule them directly. Should we fail to do so, we may find $FROMCOUNTRY$ soon taken from our control and turned into a target for a foreign power's expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95639;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in $COUNTRY$ for many years now, or perhaps we should say they are attempting to, as they have encountered considerable resistance among the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. Recently, in the southern region of Cochinchina, one of the local aristocrats took offense to the intrusion of several missionaries and executed them-- without our leave. Word of the deed has reached the attention of the French government, meaning their eye will almost certainly turn to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95640;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In $FROMCOUNTRY$, the execution of several missionaries in the Cochinchina region has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention. So far, discussion has gone nowhere and the idea has now arisen that forming a protectorate in the area may be our only solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95641;First they send their 'missionaries' into our country, flouting our laws and offending our people with their spouted nonsense. They turn our own citizens away from the righteous path, and expect us to do nothing? $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have seized upon this excuse to demand all of Cochinchina in recompense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95645;We have an issue before us. The Vietnamese rule over our kingdom, and it seems certain that, very soon, either they or the Thai will demand we submit in full and are swallowed whole. The French stand on our borders, eyeing Indochina with their own ambitions. Perhaps they will make kinder rulers? Rebellion seems almost certain to end with Cambodia being torn to pieces by both.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95646;King Norodom of Cambodia has sent our government a request: he asks that the French intervene in his nation, demanding it be released from Vietnamese control and made our protectorate. This would suit our goals in Indochina, though it risks war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95647;Cambodia has been under Vietnamese control since our war with Siam. Now it seems the Cambodia king has approached the French and asked for protection, and the French have agreed to offer it. They are demanding control over Cambodia, on threat of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95650;Many in our government believe we should press our influence in Indochina, expanding our colony there to include some of our less civilized neighbours. Perhaps the time is right for war?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC95652;French diplomats have arrived in $CAPITAL$ with a set of demands: namely that we should surrender control of all eastern territories not 'rightfully ours'. This includes all land claimed by Laotian, Khmer and Vietnamese minorities. It is an outrageous demand, of course. How dare the French claim to be 'protectors' of these people! Yet. do we dare risk war with the Europeans?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95655;We are in a difficult situation. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces cannot hold out against the French onslaught, and they plague us at every opportunity. Perhaps we must face the realities of the situation, and sit with the French at the negotiation table to give them what they want. If we fail to do so, $COUNTRY$ is surely lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96000;$COUNTRY$ is in a state of total war with one of the Great Powers of the world. In a modern age where warfare has the capability of killing millions, the very future of our nation could be at stake. The call has gone out to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people: put aside your petty differences," your day-to-day lives and your personal ambitions. $COUNTRY$ must pull together in this, our hour of need!;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96004;The constant state of war $COUNTRY$ is under has taken its toll on our people. Shortages of basic goods and the failure to deliver swift victory have worn down the enthusiasm with which the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people initially greeted the war effort. If things don't turn around soon, we could face growing weariness and unrest within our own borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96005;Growing demonstrations in $CAPITAL$ demonstrate the prevailing attitude of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people: get us out of the war, and soon. Too many have been lost, too many sacrifices made, and all for what? The people wish to go back to their regular lives, without the constant spectre of war hanging over their heads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96006;The war effort is not going well, to put it lightly. Advisors are saying that $COUNTRY$ should sue for peace, do whatever it takes to end this war before something even more terrible happens. The people are on the brink of revolt. We must act!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96010;We have lost the war, and like vultures the victors have descended upon us. We have been forced to the bargaining table to accept humiliating terms regarding the breakup of our empire, with many of our lands simply given away, and we shall be permitted no overseas holdings whatsoever. This is a moment that shall be remembered in $COUNTRY$ for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96013;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has been forced to concede defeat in its war, and we have been invited to the negotiating table to discuss the potential breakup of their empire. This could potentially mean we see $COUNTRY_ADJ$ lands returned to us, though if we forego our claims it could mean salvaging a relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96014;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has been forced to concede defeat in its war, and now treaty talks have begun to discuss the breakup of their empire. As an enemy of $FROMCOUNTRY$, our place at the table is assured. At the very least, any $COUNTRY_ADJ$ lands currently in $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ possession should be returned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96015;The defeat of $FROMCOUNTRY$ in their war has forced them to the negotiating table, and one of the terms for the breakup of their empire is our release from their direct rule. This would mean casting out $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials and potentially turning them into an enemy. We could maintain our close ties with $FROMCOUNTRY$ even with our freedom, though this would mean passing up a chance for freedom and goodwill from $FROMCOUNTRY$'s enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96016;One of the matters discussed at the treaty talks is what to do with $FROMCOUNTRY$'s colonial holdings. They should not be allowed to keep these lands, but determinining how they should be disposed of is no simple matter. For now, agreement has been reached determining some of the territory, and any remaining will have to be negotiated over in the coming year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96017;One of the matters discussed at the treaty talks is what to do with $FROMCOUNTRY$'s colonial holdings. We are not a great power, and it's possible that even if pursue some of their colonies for our own we'll end up with nothing... but if we do not try, we'll end up with nothing for sure. Even so, making the attempt could be seen as aggressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96020;With the war finished, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have taken to the streets of $CAPITAL$ in celebration. The toll of the war has been heavy, but today $COUNTRY$ is simply happy to be at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96022;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has been created from the ether, but the powers-that-be have determined at least some of their lands rightfully belong to $COUNTRY$ and should be returned to us. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have rejoiced at this news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96025;Now that we are in a state of total war, the idea has arisen that $COUNTRY$ should approach $FROMCOUNTRY$'s enemies to see if there are those who would join our side against them. This may mean an unholy alliance with those who might never fight at our side otherwise, but as the old saying goes: 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend.' If we are to win the war against $FROMCOUNTRY$, we may have to take that to heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96030;A diplomat from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us with a proposal: an alliance with them, to fight in a war against their enemy... who is certainly no friend of ours. While the alliance does not necessarily obligate us, the question really remains whether or not $COUNTRY$ even wishes to go to war. If we fight with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we stand the chance of gaining the spoils of war for ourselves. It also means we could fall with them. The choice is ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96031;We have received word from $FROMCOUNTRY$ that they have agreed to an alliance. Whether or not they will actually live up to that alliance and join us in the war remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC96065;A diplomatic incident with one of our enemies has outraged $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. Several weeks ago, an envoy assigned to $CAPITAL$ was accused of stealing national secrets. It turned out the truth was far worse, and an investigation has unearthed a conspiracy to destablize $COUNTRY$ and leave it week for invasion. This has leaked out to the public, and now crowds in the capital are calling for total war.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96066;The assassination of a prominent $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizen by a dissident has, after a thorough investigation, turned out to be at the instigation of an enemy power. This is but the latest in a string of incidents designed to destabilize $COUNTRY$. The results of the investigation have leaked to the public, and massive crowds gathered in the streets of $CAPITAL$ are now calling for total war.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96070;According to the peace treaty, our colonies and overseas territories must be surrendered. Negotiations are currently underway as to which nations they will be 'assigned' to. It appears our humiliation is not yet complete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96071;Negotiations are still underway as to which countries will obtain control over the remaining $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonies and overseas territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC96081;An isolated $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ territory has been offered to us. We should consider whether we wish to adminster it, as accessing the land may be difficult according to current borders. But, then again, do we truly wish $FROMCOUNTRY$ to keep it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96085;As the armies of our former enemy depart $CAPITAL$, they leave behind a newly-installed democratic government friendly to their nation. How long this government will last is unknown, but many within $COUNTRY$ question whether 'freedom' imposed by a foreign power is truly that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96086;As the armies of our former enemy leave $CAPITAL$, they leave behind a newly-installed right-wing government friendly to their nation.

EVTDESC96090;With the loss of $COUNTRY$ in the recent war, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy has received much of the blame-- there have already been several assassination attempts, and calls within the government for the monarchy to step down.

EVTDESC96100;A wave of nationalism has begun to spread among the Mashriqi, fueled by their resentment over $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule.

EVTDESC96106;We have received word of an uprising that has occurred in $PROVINCENAME$. A group of Mashriqi tribesman attacked the local $COUNTRY_ADJ$ garrison, and were quickly put down.

The transfer of all colonies and overseas territories to the other great powers.\n4. An agreement by $COUNTRY$ not to declare war on any other nation for a period of no less than ten years.\n\nIt goes without saying that these demands are extremely humiliating, and the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people would be justifiably upset should we agree.

EVTDESC97000;A growing dissatisfaction with the ruling government among Portugal's poor has grown into rebellion, spurred on by popular discontent with the prohibition against burials inside churches. The instigator of the initial riots is a woman by the name of Maria, and her nickname has come to be used to represent the rebellion-- which has a large contingent of peasant women among its supporters -- and which has been co-opted by revolutionaries in emulation of the rebellions elsewhere in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC97015;Upon returning to Lisbon from a brief trip abroad, King Carlos I and the royal family had their carriage fired upon by republican activists as they passed through the Terreiro do Paço. Three of the bullets struck and killed the King, while another fatally wounded the heir to the throne, Luis Filipe.

One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who subsequently demanded the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. Predictably, they have refused. This is a direct challenge to Spanish authority from a former colony. If we do not react in kind, we will lose a great deal of credibility.

EVTDESC97153;A Spanish deputy by the name of Eusebio de Salazar y Mazaredo has arrived to negotiate with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government regarding the Talambó incident. The problem, however, is that he carries with him the title of Royal Commissary. This is a title reserved for officials dealing with Spanish colonies, not ambassadors to sovereign nations. This is a deliberate insult to $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC97170;A Sudanese religious leader by the name of Muhammad Ahmad has proclaimed himself the Mahdi (or 'guided one') and begun a war to unify the tribes in western and central Sudan. While the local government in Khartoum initially dismissed this man, further reports indicate the Mahdi possesses a great deal of magnetism-- and his rallying call of driving all foreign presence out of the Sudan has gained him a large following. These Mahdists may prove to be a serious threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97171;Followers of the Mahdi have struck again, this time in the province of $PROVINCENAME$.

EVTDESC97180;Rebels in a neighboring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order.

EVTDESC97500;The French ambassador has arrived with the following demand: they wish the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to recognize them as the sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine, turning control over all Christian sites to the French. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca signed with Russia in 1774 states that they are the sole protector of Eastern Christians, and should we agree to the French demands it will almost surely lead to conflict with the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97501;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused our demand, stating that the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca grants Russia authority over Eastern Christians and not France. More than likely they simply fear what the Russians will do. A show of force combined with the enticement of a protective alliance might compel them, though that will certainly cause friction with the Russians and there are some who say we should discontinue this venture now while we still have the chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97502;The French are not willing to abandon their claims to the Holy Land. There have been several demonstrations of naval force along our coast, and these have been combined with offers of protection against Russian retaliation. If we agree, we have a friend in France but almost certainly war with the Russians. If we refuse, very likely we will have a war with France on our hands. Which would we prefer?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97503;The French have successfully pressured $FROMCOUNTRY$ into accepting their claim of authority over Christian holy sites in Palestine, authority which has traditionally belonged to us ever since the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. This is a breach of the treaty and a threat to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed that the French and the Roman Catholic Church should be the supreme Christian authority in the Holy Land, and have turned over control of Christian holy places-- including the keys to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. This is in contravention to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ treaty with Russia, and will no doubt lead to conflict, but is at the same time a boon to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97505;Through a combination of military and political pressure, we now have no choice but to accept French claims in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97506;In what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressure the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine... authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, trade routes through the Levant lead to India... and a Russian war with the Turks could directly threaten our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97507;Russia has control over $CAPITAL$, and much of our nation is either overrun or in complete chaos. We cannot continue. Our only option may be to surrender to the Russians and negotiate a treaty, in which we will doubtless be forced to hand over many concessions. Failure to do so, or should the Russians refuse our offer, could mean the war continuing for a very long time yet-- and $COUNTRY$'s utter ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us, begging for terms of surrender. It will mean relinquishing our current wargoals and sitting down with them to work out the terms of a treaty once the war is done, but we are confident they will be to $COUNTRY$'s benefit. No doubt the other powers of Europe will be far less pleased, but that is not our concern. Such a treaty will prevent this war from continuing on interminably.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97510;The powers of Europe have met in Paris to settle the recent matter of the Crimean War. One of the provisions set out is that the newly-united Romanians would receive the Budjak in southern Bessarabia (also known as Izmail). Refusing would put us at odds with the rest of Europe and perhaps lead to further war. Accepting might repair some of our relations with Romania, but would definitely be a blow to our prestige and our interests in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97512;As we suspected, the terms of Russia's treaty are punishing indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97515;To this day we remain a subject of the Turks. A growing movement has demanded our indpendence, and there are those who believe an offer of alliance with the Russians along with a guarantee of returning their lands in southern Bessarabia might entice them to support our efforts. Still others fear what a war of independence with the Turks will do to our nation. Is it worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97516;The Romanians have approached us with a deal: in exchange for our assistance in their war of independence against the Turks, they will return our lands in southern Bessarabia.

The ill-tempered westerner is demanding an end to the Japanese policy of Sokoku-- specifically trading rights in several ports, extraterritoriality for American sailors and protection for their shipwrecks. At first he demanded to negotiate with the Emperor, but that is impossible. Thus it falls to the Shogun to either agree to his demands, risking the appearance of weakness, or refuse and bring the wrath of the Americans upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97606;Commodore Perry has returned from his mission to Japan with a treaty in hand: we have gained numerous trade concessions, but more importantly we have cracked open the shield that is Japan's policy of isolation. This is a great coup for American diplomacy and influence in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97607;Commodore Perry has returned from his mission to Japan with unfortunate news: they have chosen to defy his ultimatum and thumb their collective noses at our government. Should we back down now, it will be a great blow to our prestige and our influence in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC97615;'Revere the emperor and expel the barbarians!'\n\nThis is the slogan chanted by neo-confucian activists, reacting to the Tokugawa shogunate's opening of Japan to foreigners. There have been growing reports of violence all over the country, primarily against foreign visitors and statesmen but also against the shogunate itself.

EVTDESC97620;Tokugawa Iesada, the 13th shogun of Japan, has died childless. This has begun a struggle within the bakufu to select a replacement. The southern tozama daimyo wish to see Tokugawa Yoshinobu become shogun, while the fudai daimyo and shogunate officials are more in favor of Tokugawa Iemochi-- even though he is still but a child. It seems certain that, no matter which candidate is victorious, the disaffected daimyo will see this as a loss of power and make trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97621;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Yoshinobu as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the tozama daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the tozama will be permitted more influence within the shogunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97622;Even though the fudai daimyo, the relatives and close allies of the Tokugawa clan, supported the appointment of young Iemochi as the new shogun following Iesada's death, instead the leader of the bakufu will be Yoshinobu... a candidate favored by the outsider tozama daimyo. The fudai are growing increasingly alarmed at the insidious influence of the tozama, and there is a stirring sentiment that perhaps the time has come for a grander change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97623;Pandering once again to the fudai daimyo, all relatives and close allies within the bakufu, the child Iemochi has been appointed shogun-- instead of the more sensible candidate chosen by the tozama.

EVTDESC97625;The shogun's Chief Minister has been assassinated by ronin samurai outside the very gates of Edo castle! Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate.

EVTDESC98200;The Boers are descendants of Dutch settlers in the eastern Cape Colony, and they have never sat well with British rule. More and more of them are leaving their farmsteads and moving to the east and the northeast, encroaching on territory traditionally ruled by the Xhosa and the Basotho. Conflict with those native peoples appears to be inevitable, as perhaps is conflict with the Boers themselves should we allow any lands they claim to remain independent. As far as the British government is concerned, the Boers are British subjects... no matter where they go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98205;The Boers are eager to get away from British rule, slowly leaving the lands of the Cape Colony and heading both east and north into the African wilds. The ones heading east are encroaching on Zulu territory, however, and it seems there is no end to them. They possess firearms, but we have the superior manpower... and all our chiefs agree on one thing: if we do not do something about the Boers now, they will dominate our territory and turn the Zulu people into colonial subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98206;The Boer encroachment into Zulu lands has provoked a reaction: the Battle of Blood River, prompted by the massacre of Piet Retief and his fellow pioneers after they attempted to negotiate borders for the new Natal settlement. The Voortrekkers won a decisive victory at the battle, and have now carved out a new colony-- with the only question remaining whether $COUNTRY$ will recognize their independence or treat them as subjects. Either way, further conflict seems certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98207;The Boers which have trekked eastward into Zulu lands have reached a surprising settlement with the natives: they have staked out permanent borders for their new colony, and done so in relative peace. The real question remains whether we will allow this new Natalia Republic to stand. The Boers are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ subjects, after all, and their existence will no doubt draw more Boers to their side... perhaps providing a threat to our African ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98210;The Boers of Natalia are chafing under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule, resenting the idea that even though they left the Cape Colony they still do not have true independence. There have been several altercations with $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military foces, and the recommendation of the Cape Town government is that Natal be annexed before the situation grows worse. If we do not, then we must allow the Boers to find their own way-- and suffer the loss to our prestige this would entail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC98245;Our colonial governor in South Africa declared an annexation of the Transvaal via special warrant several years ago, one that the Boers have stubbornly resisted. Both Transvaal and the Oranje Free State have considerable resources which would be of value to $COUNTRY$, and we must consider the idea that keeping them out of the hands of competitors for African dominance is just as much reason to annex them as using those resources for our ourselves. The Boer resistance has proven embarrasing.

EVTDESC98246;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have gone to war with the Transvaal, and many Boers are fearful that $COUNTRY$ will surely be next. They are crying out to our government to ally with the Transvaalis and stop the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from taking away their lands and their rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC98247;The Boers have proven far more resilient than we ever would have thought possible, and now we face the humiliating prospect of surrendering the Cape Colony to them.

EVTDESC98303;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election gets underway, it becomes clear it will be a contentious one. The issues are clear and the battle lines between parties drawn, and there are those who believe that while violence may not be the result the toppling of the current $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regime could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98304;With the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election underway, supporters of the current regime have rallied in $CAPITAL$. They claim that stability is required to deal with the problems facing $COUNTRY$, and are actively trying to shout down opposition. Whether this will mean a victory in the current election is unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98305;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election is underway, and so far has proceeded smoothly. Debates are being carried out in the usual manner, and there are no reports of violence in $CAPITAL$ or elsewhere. Supporters of the ruling regime have turned out in force, as have the hopefuls seeking to defeat the current government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98310;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election has ended, with the leader of the conservative party declaring victory from the steps of the presidential palace in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC98317;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election has ended, with the leader of the social liberal party declaring victory from the steps of the presidential palace in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC98600;There has been an increasing desire among the people of $COUNTRY$ to gain our full independence. Crowds gathering in $CAPITAL$ have demanded an end to rule by our distant overlords, and while many in the government are sympathetic with their cries there are also those who fear such a demand could lead to war. Any attempts to achieve independence should ideally take a diplomatic route first, with friendly ties maintained if peaceful separation becomes a reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98605;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ arrived in $CAPITAL$ this month, presenting a formal request for their full independence from $COUNTRY$. They assure us that they fully intend to maintain ties with our nation, and have agreed to move forward as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ allies, but that they desire their freedom even so. There are many who feel such a request is beyond the pale and must be refused out of hand. Still others say that if $FROMCOUNTRY$ is denied, we could be facing a rebellion-- and is it not better than to have a friendly ally than a recalcitrant and unwilling subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98606;Not unexpectedly, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has denied our request for independence. It seems our only option is rebellion-- as unrealistic as some claim that option to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC98607;Our diplomacy has proven successful: $COUNTRY$ has been granted full autonomy, on the condition that friendly ties be maintained with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC98610;It appears the time for diplomacy has ended. We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government that they have demanded independence-- or it will be war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;
EVTDESC98611;Since $COUNTRY$ was denied its independence, there has been talk of open rebellion in the streets of $CAPITAL$. Fighting against our overlords might surely result in us being crushed, however. Since we have no recourse, secretly approaching some of the enemies of our overlord might gain us some allies in the war to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98612;Representatives from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, asking to set up an alliance with $COUNTRY$ should their demand for independence go unheeded. So far, they say, diplomatic efforts have proven fruitless... so $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assistance would be invaluable to them, and perhaps gain us a new ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98620;With the Ottoman government having indicated its willingness to provide reforms, an intellectual class known as the Young Ottomans has arisen-- men influenced by the ideals of the French Revolution who are advocating the assumption of secular rather than religious laws as well as the provision of rights to ethnic minorities. This, they say, will help stem the tide of decay in the Empire. Most recently they have suggested embracing the Empire's Bulgarian minorities, maintaining that such a gesture would indicate a willingness to embrace European values. Mashriqi citizens have gotten wind of this, demanding that they as Muslims should receive preferential treatment. Reactionary officials have agreed, suggesting a move towards accepting the Empire's role as an Islamic power rather than away from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98621;Recently the Young Ottomans have been pushing for reform in the millet system, the governmental system under which the Empire's territories are allowed to govern themselves. The Young Ottomans say that the Albanians have been loyal servants to the Empire and their millets deserve equal treatment to those of the Turks. This would also indicate a willingness to embrace European ideals. Reactionaries have rejected this notion, suggesting the Empire embrace the Bedouin population instead. This would indicate a commitment by the Empire towards traditional values.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98622;The Young Ottomans have begun campaigning for equality to be granted to Bosnian citizens-- a European culture which is also Muslim, and the embracing of which would further indicate an alignment towards Europe. Reactionaries have been quick to suggest that if equality is going to be granted to any distant group, it should be the Maghrebi. Doing so would indicate an alignment towards reclaiming the Empire's former expanse and away from Europe and its dangerous ideas. Appeasing both groups appears to be impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98626;The current state of unrest within the Empire has reached the point where the Sultan has been advised to abrogate the Ottoman Constitution. Absolute power must be returned to the monarchy in order to stamp out the militants-- and while there are those who say that such action will only foster more unrest, there are others who are all too aware that failing to do so will make the Sultan look weak. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that reactionaries might seek to restore the monarchy by force-- or, even worse, seek to abolish it altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98630;With the recent loss of European territories, nationalists within $COUNTRY$ have been inspired to rise up. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials are concerned we could be seeing a string of rebellions in the years to come, and already the army is scrambling to contain any efforts at rebel organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98635;Spurred on by the continuing lack of reform, Ottoman liberals have radicalized into the 'Young Turks'. They seek to restore the consitutional monarchy, by force if need be, and there are those who have advised the government that these liberals must be dealt with harshly before they grow into a real problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98636;Turkish liberals have grown increasingly defiant of the Ottoman monarchy-- to the point where they suggest that the Sultan must be overthrown, replaced with a modern republic. They reject the notion of Ottomanism, saying it has already led to the Empire's decline, and that the way to restoring the nation's glory is to put the good of the Turkish people ahead of all other concerns... including religious.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98640;The Ottoman monarchy has been overthrown, and now $COUNTRY$ stands in its place. The concept of Ottomanism, an Empire formed of diverse cultures and religions, has been set aside in favor of a nation built by and for the Turkish people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98650;The call from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to $COUNTRY$, asking us to unify with their nation into a greater state-- one which will forge a greater power in a new world order. There are those $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens who fear losing our identity in such a union, but many welcome the nation and rightly state that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s influence in $COUNTRY$ is already great. If we deny the union, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government may decide to enforce their claim on us whether we like it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98655;After much discussion and deliberation, the Hungarians have agreed to expand the Austro-Hungarian union into a federation with the other Danubian cultures even if it means giving up some of their traditional claims to those lands. We may now proceed to propose the union to other local governments with full confidence that both our governments are behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC98656;After much discussion and deliberation, the Hungarians have agreed to expand the Austro-Hungarian union into a federation with the other Danubian cultures... on one condition: that they be elevated to a fully autonomous state tied to the federation only in matters of foreign relations. We can ignore their proposal, but not without causing a great deal of discontent among the Hungarian people. Sadly, this appears to be as far as their government will go on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98657;After much discussion and deliberation, the Hungarians have outright refused the proposed federation. They do not wish to lose their equal standing with the Austrian government, and see no benefit in surrendering claims to their traditional territories.

EVTDESC98720;With the loss of Hungary, the entire basis for the Danubian Federation has begun to crumble. The other ethnic groups are questioning the dominance that the German majority will exert without the Hungarians to counter-balance them, and increasingly there are demands for the federation to be undone. Some Germans are fine with this, preferring to return to the Austria that was, but many of them say that these other groups should not be permitted to break away.

EVTDESC999000;The intensive election campaign has reached the boiling point in $COUNTRY$, where a fierce trade policy debate pits the friends of free trade against the pals of protectionism in a rough rumble-and-tumble to determine the future of our nation's traders.

EVTDESC999036;There are a large number of people, particularly among the Muslims of faith in $COUNTRY$, who believe that liberal attitudes have been responsible for all of the country's ills. They advocate controls on immigration and a repeal of voting rights. They also appear to have charismatic speakers, for they seem to be gathering a lot of attention in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999037;It looks like the conservatives have discovered a talent in the current election to find the right words when and where they are needed: All over $COUNTRY$ their agenda has persuaded a lot of people to join their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;
EVTDESC999040;'Why should only the rich be allowed to vote? We also pay taxes, so why shouldn't we have something to say in politics?' \n\nThe industrial revolution has empowered the middle class. More and more businessmen are making more and more money. It seems only natural that they demand voting rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999041;'...and mind you, we even pay way higher taxes then they do! Still, their votes are worth more than ours - I ask you: is that really fair?' \n\nWhile being allowed to vote, the middle class feels diminished by the current weighted voting rights, and the subject has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999042;'Why is everyone trying to keep us out of politics? Because we are uneducated? They call us minors, but that is a lie! Our sweet and toil has brought the nation forward! We have waited long enough - now we demand our just due!' \n\nThe subject of voting rights for the poor has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999043;'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed' \n - Thomas Jefferson;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999044;'They have beaten me, again and again. Why? Because I am a proud citizen who will speak the truth! I don't believe that the ruling party will save us. And my weapon is logic, but theirs is the stick.'\n\nThe issue of political party harassment has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999045;'Why are they allowed to change the rules during an election? Drawing random borders to scatter those who won't vote for them is not fair. It is fraud, I tell you! They divided our district between four others, because they knew how we would vote. FRAUD! That's what it is, I tell you!'\n\nThe issue of voter district gerrymandering has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999046;'Why does everyone stare at me when I make my vote? Do they really need to know? It is not like I am committing a crime or something, I simply want to vote in peace. Without having half of the polling station looking at me, that is.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999049;The election is almost over, but liberals and socialists are still arguing about the current state of affairs. Unemployment is a problem, but both sides have decisive arguments for what they think has to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999050;Unemployment is still an important issue in $COUNTRY$, but all our recent attempts to crate new jobs have failed. During the election of $YEAR$, communists and fascists argued that their dogma is the only one that will give work to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999055;A recent mine accident that led to the deaths of five children, all labourers working under the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ child labor laws, has led to a national debate over the issue. Children wearing protest signs have shown up at political debates, causing quite a stir and raising the question over whether the government should consider reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999056;A demonstration by minorities in $CAPITAL$, denouncing the fact that 'universal suffrage' in $COUNTRY$ does not include them, has drawn attention throughout the country and sparked debates over whether minorities should be given the right to vote. Reactionaries are incensed at the idea, claiming that only 'true' $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens should decide its government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999057;Immigration has long been a thorny issue in $COUNTRY$, with many citizens maintaining the opinion that allowing too many foreigners into the country leads to chaos and unemployment. $COUNTRY$ should be for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, and no others. Despite this, the plight of immigrants who are longing to be reunited with family currently located elsewhere has received a great deal of attention in the current election. There have been demonstrations by liberals in $CAPITAL$ calling for immigration reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999060;So far the war has dominated talk in the election, with a number of jingoistic politicians rousing the people with fiery speeches. 'We must protect $COUNTRY$!', they cry. '$COUNTRY$ must be mighty!' It seems they are being listened to, as so far they have enjoyed success throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999061;While $COUNTRY$ is not currently at war, there are those who think it should be. 'They are ripe for the picking, and $COUNTRY$ must strike now! While we are strong!' They are referring to one of our hated neighbours, who some jingoists feel should be a target for expansion. Permitting such talk will make us look aggressive to the international community, however, though it may also be an opportunity of which to take advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999065;A recent incident involving the death of several slaves at the hands of their owner has gained national attention in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election, with both sides pouncing on the debate. Abolitionists say that this is but one more example of slavery being responsible for the inhumane treatment of one's fellow man. Proponents claim this is a matter for the courts to resolve, and accuse the Abolitionists of stirring up an isolated incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Una de las más sugerentes obras literarias de la historia, 'Los hermanos Karamazov' era una comedia que desarrollaba los temas de su carrera como escritor postsocialista. Puede que se tratase de una comedia, pero tal vez fuera la comedia más seria jamás escrita. En sus memorias, 'El diario de un escritor', Dostoievski rechazó las acusaciones de la izquierda a su trabajo diciendo que ningún izquierdista había escrito una crítica del cristianismo más devastadora que los capítulos 'Rebelión' y 'El Gran Inquisidor' de los hermanos Karamazov.

El espíritu del cambio revolucionario socialista ha invadido un número cada vez mayor de áreas. Las causas de los conflictos están claras: la tremenda expansión de las empresas industriales, en las transformadas relaciones entre patrones y trabajadores, en las enormes fortunas de unos pocos individuos y la total pobreza de las masas y en la imperante degeneración moral. El socialismo amenaza los cimientos religiosos y morales del estado y pretende causar una ruptura en los intereses que comparten la iglesia, el estado, el patrón y el empleado, y los sustituye con una perversa doctrina atea. Deben nacer asociaciones que satisfagan las necesidades del progreso pero que protejan a los débiles. Como dice el apóstol San Pablo, 'La caridad es paciente, es amable... no busca lo suyo... sufre todas las cosas... soporta todas las cosas'.;El trabajo merece ser tan valorado como la riqueza.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Estalló un enfrentamiento y la policía arrestó a Louis Pio y a otros líderes socialistas. Pio fue condenado a cinco años de prisión.;¡Encerrémoslos!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36203;Pay him off and let's be done with him;Le payer pour qu'il parte;Bestecht ihn, damit er das Land verlässt;En 1875, el líder socialista Louis Pio fue indultado por el cumpleaños del rey y volvió a liderar el entonces pujante movimiento socialdemócrata. Pero su liderazgo causó varios conflictos y, a finales de 1875, emigró repentinamente a América. Luego se descubrió que la policía le había sobornado para que se marchase.;Paguémosle y acabemos con esto;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36204;Free the slaves;Libérer les esclaves;Sklaven befreien;En 1878 hubo una rebelión de esclavos en las Islas Vírgenes danesas.

Sus obras conmocionaron a las capas altas de la sociedad hasta tal punto que en un principio fueron prohibidas. Sus cuadros crearon conciencia de las terribles condiciones en que vivían los menos afortunados.;Son unas imágenes tan inquietantes...;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36401;The people's language for the nation;La langue du peuple pour la nation;Die Sprache des Volkes für die Nation.;El profesor Ivar Aasen (1813-1896), hijo de un agricultor, vio la necesidad de una reforma del lenguaje escrito noruego, que hasta ese momento había sido el danés. Mediante varios viajes por el país, visitando pequeñas aldeas y comunidades agrícolas, creó una gramática y un diccionario para un 'nuevo' idioma noruego. Aunque su codificación del lenguaje hablado no sirvió de mucho a la hora de educar a aquellos a quienes quería ayudar, muchos de sus poemas y textos fueron convertidos en canciones y, de ese modo, se difundieron por el mundo rural. Poco antes de su muerte, su nuevo idioma recibió el reconocimiento oficial del parlamento noruego.;La lengua del pueblo para la nación;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36402;Damn authors!;Sacrés écrivains !;Verdammte Autoren!;En el último tramo del siglo XIX, Noruega fue sacudida por las obras de los importantes autores Henrik Ibsen, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Alexander Kielland y Jonas Lie. Sus novelas y sus obras de teatro del género realista enfurecieron al sistema, causaron discusiones por todo el país y despejaron el terreno para grandes reformas sociales.;¡Malditos escritores!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36403;A platform to defend our interests.;Un tremplin pour défendre nos intérêts.;Eine Plattform zur Verteidigung unserer Interessen.;En 1884, Johan Sverdrup, de la facción liberal del Storting, exigió que el gobierno se basara en una mayoría parlamentaria.

EVTOPTA36405;Dangerous ideas spreading.;De nouvelles idées dangereuses se propagent.;Gefährliche Ideen verbreiten sich.;Marcus Thrane, inspirado por los sentimientos revolucionarios europeos de 1848, comenzó a crear sindicatos de obreros y trabajadores.

Jenny Lind fue la primera superestrella sueca, famosa tanto por su canto exquisitamente expresivo y su increíble técnica vocal como por su forma de ser sincera, humilde y sin pretensiones. Ganó una fortuna gracias a sus conciertos y sus apariciones en óperas, y destinó grandes sumas a fines benéficos.;Un artista genial;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36601;Education for the masses!;L'éducation pour tous !;Bildung für die Massen!;En 1842 se introdujo en Suecia la enseñanza primaria obligatoria.

EVTOPTA36602;Speak free!;Liberté de parole !;Freie Meinungsäußerung!;El periódico vespertino sueco Aftonbladet apareció por primera vez el 6 de diciembre de 1830, bajo la dirección de Lars Johan Hierta. El gobierno no lo miraba con muy buenos ojos, ya que estaba a favor de la libertad de expresión, el libre comercio, la rebaja de las tasas aduaneras y las reformas democráticas. Despreciado por la clase alta y adorado por la clase media, el rey intentó en vano impedir su publicación, pero su tirada aumentó rápidamente durante los años siguientes. Con sus opiniones liberales, la importancia del Aftonbladet fue fundamental en la lucha por la libertad de prensa en Suecia.;¡Libertad de expresión!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36603;Call out the troops!;Qu'on appelle la troupe !;Ruft die Truppen zu Hilfe!;1848 fue un año de revoluciones y disturbios en Europa.

La turba causó grandes destrozos en la ciudad, causando daños materiales y atacando a quienes le resultaban antipáticos. El rey, Óscar I, consiguió personalmente que la turba diese media vuelta, pero pronto se trasladó a otras partes de la ciudad para continuar su labor de destrucción. El rey acabó perdiendo la paciencia y llamando al ejército. Murieron alrededor de 30 personas y muchas más resultaron heridas.;¡Que intervengan las tropas!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Estalló una huelga espontánea y organizada que llegó a alcanzar a 21 aserraderos y a afectar a 6.000 trabajadores. Fue la primera huelga a gran escala en Suecia. Unió a los trabajadores y sirvió como un primer punto de partida para los movimientos de las clases obrera y socialdemócrata, así como para la organización de los sindicatos en décadas venideras.;¡Ley y orden, por favor!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36611;Intriguing!;Curieux !;Fesselnd!;August Strindberg (1849-1912) fue una de las personalidades de más talento de la literatura mundial. Autor teatral, novelista y escritor de cuentos cortos, sus trabajos exhibían una furia y un genio que combinaban el naturalismo, la psicología y el misticismo. 'La cámara roja' le lanzó a la fama en 1879. Satirizó a las instituciones y la situación de Suecia de finales de la década de 1870. Strindberg, hombre polifacético, sentía un odio fanático hacia la mujer emancipada, sentía interés por la ciencia y el ocultismo ¡y también hizo sus pinitos en la pintura, la fotografía y la alquimia!;¡Fascinante!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36612;Yes, our defense must be strong!;Oui, nous devons nous défendre !;Ja, wir brauchen starke Verteidigungsanlagen !;En 1900, el parlamento sueco tomó la decisión de construir un vasto sistema de fortificaciones en Boden, cerca de la frontera con Finlandia.

En 'Det går an' desafía las opiniones tradicionales sobre el matrimonio y el papel de la mujer en la sociedad. El libro causó rápidamente un escándalo.;¡Qué bueno!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36615;These are hard times indeed.;Les temps sont durs;Das sind wirklich harte Zeiten.;La década de 1880 fue mala para el sector agrícola. Si a eso sumamos una población en continuo crecimiento y un descontento cada vez mayor, estos problemas desencadenaron una ola de emigraciones masivas. Durante toda la década de 1880 se dio una emigración de familias a un ritmo preocupante. Más de 340.000 ciudadanos partieron hacia América, donde había más espacio y más oportunidades.;Sí, corren malos tiempos.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36616;Yes, accept the reform.;Oui, accepter la réforme;Ja, die Reform annehmen.;Siguiendo una propuesta de Louis De Geer, se decidió que el arcaico sistema parlamentario sueco, con sus cuatro estados de nobleza, clero, burgueses y campesinos, sería reemplazado por un parlamento compuesto de dos cámaras con los mismos derechos. A pesar de esta reforma liberal, la democracia aún estaba muy lejos. El sistema era injusto y creó una elite de prósperos hombres de negocios. Aquello dio lugar a un movimiento a escala nacional solicitando el sufragio universal para hombres y mujeres.;Sí, aceptar la reforma.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36617;Give them the right;Accorder ce droit;Gebt ihnen dieses Recht!;Carlos XIV, rey de Suecia y Noruega, cedió ante las exigencias del Storting y permitió que los barcos noruegos viajasen bajo bandera noruega en todas las aguas del mundo.;Darles el derecho;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Posteriormente, el movimiento flamenco conduciría a la formación de, por ejemplo, partidos que presionaban pidiendo más derechos para los flamencos en la vida diaria política.;¡Nuevas ideas en marcha!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36702;We must help those suffering;Nous devons aider ceux qui souffrent;Wir müssen den Leidenden helfen!;Los años entre 1845 y 1850 se convirtieron en algunos de los peores para la población belga, especialmente para los flamencos.

Eso condujo a un largo periodo de hambre y pobreza, especialmente grave en la parte rural de Flandes. Aquel trágico periodo se prolongó hasta 1850.;Debemos ayudar a los que sufren;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36703;Form the Association;Former l'Association;Verband gründen;Cuando, en 1846, se fundó la Asociación por el libre comercio (Association pour la Liberté Commerciale), Bélgica se encontraba aún bajo los efectos de la epidemia de la patata y la hambruna subsiguiente.

EVTOPTA36912;Is the shipwreck then a harvest, does tempest carry grain for thee?;Je m'éveille et sens la chute des ténèbres et non le jour.;Ihre Ingestalt ist aus Kraft und Anmut gemischt …;Las obras completas de poesía de Gerard Manley Hopkins se publicaron póstumamente en 1918, pese a que el propio Hopkins se negó a su publicación en vida. La poesía presentó al mundo una nueva métrica conocida como 'sprung-rhythm' (ritmo saltado), que proporcionó un gran estímulo al creciente movimiento modernista. La poesía de Hopkins era modernista, pero al mismo tiempo se le considera un poeta religioso. Se convirtió al catolicismo en su juventud y fue estudiante y profesor de filosofía cristiana medieval.;¿Acaso es el naufragio una cosecha, acaso la tormenta acarrea tu grano?;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Lächerlich!;Basándose en las observaciones realizadas por él mismo durante su famoso viaje a bordo del Beagle, el científico Charles Darwin, publicó su obra 'El origen de las especies', en la que afirmaba que todas las formas de vida terrestres se habían desarrollado mediante un proceso de la ley del más fuerte, no mediante un acto de creación. Sus opiniones fueron rebatidas con vehemencia entonces y ahora.;¿Que el hombre procede de los simios? ¡Absurdo!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36924;I say, anyone for Tennis?;Qui veut faire une partie ?;Hey, wer hat Lust auf Tennis?;En 1877 se celebró el primer torneo individual de tenis para hombres en el All-England Club, en Wimbledon.

EVTOPTA36925;Repress these depraved criminals!;Réprimons ces criminels dépravés !;Unterdrückt diese verdorbenen Kriminellen!;El asesinato de al menos 6 prostitutas por Jack el Destripador, el más célebre asesino en serie moderno, horrorizó y conmocionó a la sociedad victoriana. Sin embargo, la consternación ante este horror tuvo el efecto indirecto de llamar su atención sobre la extrema pobreza y depravación que reinaban muy cerca de ellos, en las calles del este de Londres, sobre todo en Whitechapel, lugar en el que tuvieron lugar los crímenes. Aunque las autoridades estaban demasiado ocupadas intentando encontrar al psicópata, cosa que nunca conseguirían, los problemas sociales siguieron pesando en la conciencia de los ingleses durante los años venideros.;¡Que repriman a esos criminales depravados!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36926;Bravo!;Bravo !;Bravo!;La producción de Samuel Phelps de 'El sueño de una noche de verano' le ha devuelto la magia a Shakespeare.

EVTOPTA36934;An idea long since due;Il était temps;Das wurde aber auch Zeit;En parte como reacción al tremendo fracaso de los oficiales de la nobleza en la Guerra de Crimea, y en parte como reacción a una tendencia antiaristocrática, Gran Bretaña suprime en 1871 la costumbre de permitir la adquisición de cargos de oficiales. De ahora en adelante, los oficiales por lo menos tendrán que recibir una instrucción. Aunque el ejército se volvió más profesional, su tendencia de cargar ciegamente se vio ligeramente reducida, ante la consternación de algunos oficiales veteranos.;Una idea que debió aplicarse hace mucho;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA37213;Vive la difference!;Vive la différence !;Vive la difference!;En 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville publicó su obra 'La democracia en América', que fue inmediatamente reconocida como un clásico tanto en América como en Francia. En ella comentaba la beligerancia y religiosidad de los americanos, algo que aún hoy sigue resultando un misterio para los europeos. Tocqueville es uno de los pocos historiadores que tienen más de un clásico en su haber.

Aunque recibió el perdón del presidente y fue luego exonerado en 1906, el resultado de todo el asunto fue un aumento del anticlericalismo y el antimilitarismo, y la unificación de la izquierda francesa.;Caso cerrado;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA44100;Well then I'll go to Hell!;Bien, qu'il aille au diable !;Na dann zur Hölle mit mir!;Mark Twain edita en 1885 'Las aventuras de Huckleberry Finn', que supuso una revolución total de la literatura americana de ficción. Hasta su publicación, la literatura de ficción americana había tendido a utilizar la forma y el lenguaje de sus predecesoras europeas. Mark Twain rompió una lanza en nombre de la independencia lingüística al utilizar el lenguaje de los analfabetos y americanos de condición humilde. El libro constituía un claro intento de mostrar que la gente de toda condición es merecedora de respeto en base a sus actos y no a su clase social. En su momento causó un escándalo debido a su estilo poco convencional, y, por lo general, su mensaje fue ignorado. Incluso hoy en día hay gente que no se da cuenta.;¡Bueno, pues entonces iré al infierno!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA44102;You shall not crucify mankind on a cross of gold;Tu ne crucifieras pas l'humanité sur une croix d'or;Du sollst die Menschheit nicht auf einem Kreuz aus Gold kreuzigen;El candidato presidencial William Jennings Bryan reclama la acuñación en plata, lo que le ganó nominaciones por parte de los partidos Populista, Republicano Plateado, Nacional Plateado y Progresista, uniendo a los agricultores del oeste y el sur bajo una causa común por primera vez desde las guerras de clases. Su nominación es vista por los empresarios del norte como un intento de sabotear a los acreedores y romper los cárteles.;No crucificarás a la humanidad en una cruz de oro;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44103;It is right and proper to return it.;Il est juste de le rendre.;Es ist richtig und angemessen, es zurückzugeben.;Encuentran a la deriva el HMS Resolute en el Atlántico Norte, tras haber sido abandonado por el escuadrón en busca del explorador polar perdido Sir John Franklin.

EVTOPTA44104;You can never be too educated.;On n'est jamais trop instruit.;Zu schlau sein gibt es nicht.;El político y abogado Horace Mann comenzó sus reformas del sistema educativo de Massachussetts.

Sus objetivos eran y son el respaldo de investigaciones y expediciones, y la popularización de la ciencia.;Hay más cosas en el cielo y en la tierra...;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44106;Speech is a kind of act.;Le discours est une forme d'action;Sprechen ist eine Art zu Handeln;La primera colección de ensayos de Emerson se publicó en 1841, y presentó al mundo una nueva y mística filosofía, autóctona del Nuevo Mundo. Aunque muchos europeos no le consideraban demasiado 'filosófico' per se, su influencia sobre el pensamiento continental es inconfundible, particularmente en Nietzsche.;El habla es un arte.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44107;The law is the will of he whom the sheriff will obey.;La loi, c'est la volonté de celui à qui obéit le shérif;Das Gesetz ist der Wille desjenigen, dem der Sheriff gehorcht.;Oliver Wendell Holmes publica en 1861 'El derecho consuetudinario' una historia de la tradición del derecho consuetudinario. En este libro afirmaba que la ley no era algo lógico, sino más bien la voluntad del juez templada por las circunstancias, o, como rezaba su máxima más conocida: 'la vida del derecho consuetudinario no ha sido lógica, sino experimental'. Se convirtió rápidamente en un clásico, Holmes accedió a un puesto de profesor en Harvard al año siguiente, y acabó formando parte del Tribunal Supremo de los Estados Unidos. La publicación de 'El derecho consuetudinario' fue un síntoma del auge del pragmatismo entre los intelectuales americanos, y presagiaba una creciente desconfianza del moralismo tras la terrible masacre de la Guerra Civil.;La ley es la voluntad de aquel a quien obedezca el sheriff.;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44108;I must have them!;Il me le faut !;Das muss ich lesen!;Ulysses S. Grant publica sus memorias, en las que relata casi toda su vida. Escribió el libro estando enfermo de un cáncer de laringe, para intentar mantener a su familia después de su muerte. Considerada universalmente una obra maestra de la literatura americana, las memorias de Grant se caracterizan por su sinceridad, claridad y economía de estilo. Mark Twain las comparó favorablemente con los Comentarios de Julio César. Las memorias fueron un éxito fenomenal en su momento y siguen siendo uno de los pocos libros que no han estado descatalogados en ningún momento desde la Guerra Civil. Probablemente sea el mejor libro escrito por un presidente americano.;¡Tengo que comprármelas!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44109;Sea power is the arbiter of victory.;La puissance maritime est l'arbitre de la victoire.;Seemacht ist der Schlüssel zum Sieg.;Alfred Thayer Mahan publica 'La influencia del poderío naval sobre la historia', examinando la importancia del poderío naval a lo largo de la historia.

EVTOPTA44110;To attack one's country while the sword is in her hand is treason;Attaquer un pays en état de guerre, c'est de la trahison;Angriff eines Landes mit dem Schwert in der Hand ist Verrat;En respuesta a un creciente sentimiento antibelicista y sindicalista entre los reclutas y las clases bajas, el Congreso aprobó una versión corregida de las leyes de 1799 contra los inmigrantes nacionalizados y la sedición, en la que ilegalizaba las críticas al presidente y la política de la nación en tiempo de guerra, además de perjudicar gravemente a los ciudadanos de procedencia extranjera y a los que acudían en busca de asilo. Mantenidas por el Tribunal Supremo en varias sentencias claves a lo largo de la década siguiente, estas leyes continuarían existiendo en diversas formas hasta ser anuladas medio siglo después. Durante la primera guerra mundial, los 166 miembros de los comités ejecutivos de la Internacional de Trabajadores de la Industria serían arrestados y juzgados, hundiendo al sindicato para siempre.;Es una traición atacar al propio país cuando éste empuña la espada;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA44300;Macdonald must resign!;Macdonald doit démissionner !;Macdonald muss zurücktreten!;Después de que la administración conservadora consiguiese la mayoría en las elecciones al parlamento de 1871, se presentaron muy serias acusaciones contra John A. Macdonald. El proyecto favorito de John A. Macdonald era el ferrocarril transcontinental, y la administración liberal le acusaba de que Sir Hugh Allan había donado fondos para su campaña a cambio de un contrato garantizado con su compañía, la Canadian Pacific. Pese a sus protestas de inocencia, Macdonald se vio obligado a dimitir como primer ministro. La falta de confianza de Donald A. Smith en Macdonald sólo sirvió para impulsar el declive de la popularidad del partido.;¡Macdonald debe dimitir!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44301;Listen to the Métis demands;Écouter les revendications des métis;Forderungen der Métis anhören;Los mestizos eran una agrupación de pequeñas comunidades de ascendencia mixta francesa e india de la región de Manitoba que tenían esperanzas de autogobierno. Por desgracia, sus sueños se vinieron abajo cuando el territorio de la Bahía de Hudson del que formaban parte fue entregado a Canadá sin su consentimiento. Como protesta, los mestizos se sublevaron al mando de Louis Riel. Louis Riel era un hombre profundamente religioso que estudió para sacerdote en su juventud. Luchó por los mestizos y fue considerado un héroe a ojos de la gente de Manitoba. Louis negoció con el gobierno canadiense el ingreso de Manitoba en la confederación. Los delegados canadienses aseguraron que se respetarían los derechos de la gente. De este modo nació la provincia de Manitoba.;Escuchar las peticiones de los mestizos;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44302;The Métis are up in arms;Les métis ont pris les armes;Die Métis haben sich bewaffnet;Aunque el gobierno canadiense prometió respetar los derechos de los mestizos, no parece que fuera así. Las peticiones de los mestizos de que sus posesiones e instituciones fuesen reconocidas se desoyeron. Los mestizos también se sentían cada vez más disgustados ante la invasión de sus territorios por un creciente número de colonos procedentes del este. A principios de 1885, la situación estalló cuando los mestizos volvieron a tomar las armas y se rebelaron. Adoptando el 'Proyecto de ley revolucionario', los mestizos establecieron su propio gobierno, independizándose de Canadá. La rebelión fue aplastada por las tropas canadienses. Louis Riel fue juzgado y ejecutado. Los mestizos tardarían cien años en ser reconocidos oficialmente como pueblo.;Los mestizos están furiosos;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Considerable effort was put into circumventing sanctions, and the government even went so far as to develop nuclear weapons, with the help of several different sources; these sources allegedly include Israel. The term "front-line states" referred to countries in Southern Africa geographically near South Africa. Although these front-line states were all opposed to apartheid, many were economically dependent on South Africa. In 1980, they formed the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC), the aim of which was to promote economic development in the region and hence reduce dependence on South Africa. Many SADCC members allowed the exiled ANC and Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) to establish bases.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Indeed, the drain theory was the high-water mark of the nationalist leaders' comprehensive, interrelated, and integrated economic analysis of the colonial situation.

The total number of prisoners used as labor force during this period is unknown, with the total number of deaths being estimated at several thousand.

EVT_1209000_DESC;For centuries before 1945, Korea had been a unified political entity. The origins of the modern division of Korea trace to the period of Japan's colonial rule over Korea (1910-1945). During World War II, the Allied leaders fighting Japan considered the question of Korea's future after Japan's surrender in the war. The leaders reached an understanding that Korea would be liberated from Japan but would be placed under an international trusteeship until the Koreans would be deemed ready for self-rule. Beyond this rather vague agreement, much about the future of Korea was left uncertain. Towards the end of World War II, the U.S. proposed dividing the Korean peninsula into two occupation zones (a U.S. and Soviet one). An assumption behind this division of Korea into two occupation zones was that this was only a temporary arrangement until the wartime agreement on the Korean trusteeship could be implemented, leading to the establishment of a unified Korean state over the entire peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

The Soviet Union boycotted the voting and did not consider the resolution to be binding, arguing that the UN could not guarantee fair elections.

Violent protests immediately broke out following President Mangope's announcement that Bophuthatswana would boycott the South African general elections.

EVTDESC8007771;Crucial for the development of the Republic the 1948 Elections, the first under a republican regime and since the establishment of fascism, have been preceded by a period of conflict between catholic and communist forces, reaching their climax with the seizure of a ministry in Milan. The main contenders for this round are the FDP (Popular Democratic Front for Freedom, Peace, Labour) a wide front composed by the PCI, the PSI (Former PSIUP) and minor leftist parties and a Centrist coalition lead by the DC and consisiting of the other government parties: US (Socialist Unity, a list lead by the PSLI, the Socialist Party of Italian Workers, a reformist PSI split), BN (National Blocs, a list leaded by the PLI, the Italian Liberal Party) and the PRI (Italian Republican Party).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8007772;The Central Committee of the PCI has declared the resignation of Prime Minister Umberto Terracini following the scandalous shooting on General Secretary Togliatti. The PCI claims that although having won the elections by a fair margin they do not feel confident ruling over an opposition that encouraged politically motivated shootings and to this day struggles to condemn the action. There is rumours that President of the Republic Luigi Einaudi, a long-time liberal, might not accept the resignations, claiming that this is an elaborate tactic by the PCI to swing the popular opinion in their way and fill the cabinet with their fellow travelers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020312;This year's elections will be characterized by the recent introduction of the so called Legge Truffa (Scam law), an electoral reform that will reward the party or list that reached 50% of the voting share 65% of the seats in both houses.

Against the reform sided the PCI and the PSI, that mantain a united tactic although having disbaded the FDP after defeat in 1948 and the PNM (National Monarchist Party) and MSI (Italian Social Movement), two organizations belonging to the far right, respectively monarchist and neo-fascist, set to increase their vote share thanks to the recent campaign.

Now the DC National Convention will have to find a new leader to rally behind and hopefully form a government. Parliamentary talks have pushed forwards various options: an administrative government headed by Giuseppe Pella and with the support of liberals and monarchists whose only purpose is to fix the state budget, a centrist government headed by Mario Scelba seeking to keep the old coalition together by handing out key ministries to socialdemocrats and liberals, a centrist government headed by Amintore Fanfani who will try to move the centrist coalition left by handing out positions to socialdemcorats and republicans or a centrist government in the Scelba's vein but headed by centre-right Antonio Segni who will try dialogue with rightist forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As communist Pietro Ingrao held a speech in parliament condeming the hungarian rebels and only the PCI clapped the coalition tensions have become clear and leftist factions within the DC have begun pushing forward the idea of an anti-communist alliance with the PSI now that it has severed ties with Togliatti and the USSR.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020315;The Italian economic miracle is the term used by historians, economists and the mass media to designate the prolonged period of strong economic growth in Italy after the Second World War from the 1950s to the late 1960s, and in particular the years from 1950 to 1963. This phase of Italian history represented not only a cornerstone in the economic and social development of the country—which was transformed from a poor, mainly rural, nation into a global industrial power—but also a period of momentous change in Italian society and culture. As summed up by one historian, by the end of the 1970s, "social security coverage had been made comprehensive and relatively generous. The material standard of living had vastly improved for the great majority of the population.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020316;This year's electoral climate has been characterized by the crisis of the DC and her centrist coalition since the fall of De Gasperi VII and his death a year later. Two lines have arisen from recent political developments: Fanfani and Moro's centre-left line pushing for an alliance with the PSI through the PSDI, starting from seeking outside support to an eventual integration into the governing coalition and Segni's centre-right line seeking a common flag with the PLI and minor collaboration with PNM and MSI through a one party government seeking support issue by issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Although creating outrage in Rome this coalition, that would for the first time allow MSI's neo-fascists in a regional junta, got the blessing of PCI chairman Palmiro Togliatti and it seems that the formula results popular in the southernmost region and her rebellious people who since the allied invasion have been showing sympathies for separatism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020318_DESC;Fanfani's centre-left experiment has fallen at its first crisis. While the PSI fresh of its new political direction was busy forming a majority position within the central committee to back that up, the ruling PSDI suffered a split caused by their leftist faction trying to mediate a re-conjunction of the two parties that had split in 1947 due to the establishment of the Popular Democratic Front, prompting the resignation of PSDI's Labour's Minister Vigorelli. This split caused the ruling coalition to find itself in minority and Prime Minister Fanfan has already signed his resignation both as head of government and as national secretary of the DC. Now the party is a crossroad, shall Aldo Moro take the role and continue this leftist experiment seeking more cooperation and cohesion or has it proved itself a failure and only Antonio Segni and his rightist strategy can save the party from these events?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020319_DESC;Following the establishment of the first centre-right government in the history of the Republic, the reliance on MSI and monarchist votes has created a climate of discomfort within the poitical climate.

After various re-scheduling the congress was held on the outskirts of the city as the city was swarmed by anti-fascist protestors who quickly got provoked by their rightist opponents, kickstartinga a spree of vioence that saw the local citizenry clash with the police in the narrow street of the city causing a death and several wounded. The government faces a touchy situation and although the public opinion seems against them after the wave of violence that swept the country in the following days, causing death in various cities, more conservative elements have been arguing to not cede in to the protestors who could gain legittimacy from concessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020320;Since the end of Fascism and the elections of 1945 in the Republic of San Marino, a coalition of communists and socialists has lead the government. In 1957 5 parliamentarians from the socialist party left the ruling coalition and founder their own Independent Socialist Party of San Marino, creating a crisis in the little republic as now the council found itself locked in a 30-30 gridlock. On the 19th of September Captain-General elections were meant to be held but the day before the date the leftist parliamentary group, including the 5 who left, signed resignation letters as they they did every elections to ensure accountability, with the majority of seats vacant in the council there was no quorum, so the regency dissolved the council until new elections in November, but the Captain0s term ended in October, creating a constitutional crisis. The captains ordered the police to seal the council to not let anyone in, so the pposition formed by Christian Democrats and Moderate Socialists met in Rovereta and formed a rival government. The riva provvisional government has come to us to seek help and recognition and thus we have to take a stance on the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Clashes between the police, protesters and counter-protesters have intensified and a bloc of former SVP politicians, autonomists from the DC and a coalition of socialists and communists have been rallying for the government to legalize the SVP back, as some fringes suggest also to renew autonomy to the region as promised by the 1946 agreements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_8020327_DESC;In reaction to a summer of strikes, terror attacks and political violence the situation in our northernmost province has reached a hot point leaving us no choice but to enact special laws. The current consensus is to give the local autonomous government emergency powers, allowing them to enact martial law within the borders of the region and suppress dissent and re-establish order, prompting though a break of the 1946 De Gasperi-Gruber Agreements and thus allowing an eventual negative austrian reaction. Minority voices have been pushing for the abolition of the autonomous region altogether, delegating all the power to the government in Rome and taking the matter in our hands risking a show-off with the local population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020328_DESC;The Befreiungsausschuss Südtirol, the SVP and a series of local autonomist organizations have subscripted a declaration of independence of the South Tyrolean State as a reaction to the repressive policies of the italian government in Rome.

The young nation has declared intention to seek unification with other german speaking nations in their secession speech delivered through a broad channel of regional radios and quoted "italian 'fascist' policies" as their main cause for independence. Inter-ethnic violence in Bozen has reached historical heights not seen since the First World War and the government in Rome has pledged to restore order and the constitution to the northern citizens, by force if necessary.

The accident has caused many rumours to circulate as it is suspected it was an ordered attempt, already in january, during a fly to Morocco to meet with the Sultan, a screwdrier was found in the cockpit and lately Mattei had been threatened by the OAS due to his financial aid to Algerian separatists. A controversial man, Mattei rose through the ranks of italian society starting from AGIP and the foundation of ENI thanks to a shady mixture of business and politics. The former partisan has long been a major member of the DC and during his time as manager of ENI he used his power to influence italian politics, through official parties such as the DC and even the neo-fascist MSI and thanks to Il Giorno, a newspaper published by the company. Mattei's long involvement in the third world, his closeness to the Shah and his antagonism to the "Seven Sisters" made him a prime target of allied secret services, who might be colluded in the incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020330;It is once again elections time and this year the climate has been characterized by the end of the crisis of Centrism. After a brief and controversial period of Centre-Right government the ruling DC seems to have settled for the road to an "organic" Centre-Left, anticipated by the outsider support given by the PSI to the last government and that will finally allow the socialists to enter government with organic ministers. If the voters appreciated the leftwards turn of the DC the time shall finally be ready for this new formula, but if the numbers turn against the Centre-Left the DC may have little to have but re-purpose the old Centrist formula and shift back to the right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020331;For the first time since the end of Fascism a majority Right-wing government with organic partecipation by forces such as the MSI might take power and give an answer to the crisis of Centrism the DC entered after last elections. After a period of long struggle with social-communist forces the Centre-Right government has managed to legitimize itself to the italian public and if this new formula will show herself victorious a broader front of the Right can be formed for order and prosperity. Shall the voters not confirm the Centre-Right there will be little to no chances but to come to terms with the PSI, that after having embraced a reformist road has been trying to position itself as the mediator between the left and the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Togliatti had traveled to the USSR to meet with Leonid Brezhnev. A hero of the Resistance Togliatti lead his party to become the biggest non-ruling Communist party in Europe and the second biggest party in the country.

EVTDESC8020333;The political climate of this year's elections has been shaped by the Student's Contestation, a movement arose within Italy's major Universities asking for an education reform, the liberalization of sex and solidarity with workers. The student's movement made headlines occupying entire faculties and clashing with the police at Valle Giulia. Those events were later followed by a series of industrial strikes by workers and the ideological climate has been subject to a shift to the Left. The ruling DC has been pushing for a Centre-Left Coalition with the socialists, that after having found a renewed alliance in the latest governments following PSI's reformist turn, have re-united into the PSI-PSDI, also nicknamed Unified Socialist Party, but that have also suffered a split to the left from the PSIUP (Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity) hardliners. Shall this development on the left satisfy the voters, it is very likely that the Organic Centre-Left formula might be brought back to quell the discontent. Shall the socialists score bad it seems like the DC will have little choice but to form a bridge government until an agreement with the political forces that today deny any collaboration with their oppositions (PCI, PSIUP, MSI, PDI and PLI) can be secured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_8020334_DESC;After the 1968 elections the failure of the re-united PSI-PSDI forced the government to form a temporary bridge government under the leadership of Giovanni Leone, having the bridge served its purpose the ruling DC finds herself at a crossroad: either the Centre-Left or early elections. The internal disputes of the PSI-PSDI make the formation of a tripartite DC-PSI-PSDI-PRI government very hard, but it is possible that under the guidance of former secretary Mariano Rumor the opposing views could be mended to avoid calling the first early elections in the history of the republic, especially amidsts the current crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020335;The first early elections of the Republic, this year's elections have to put an end to the crisis the DC has been living for the past decade: shall the Centre-Left finally confirm itself or will the party have to look rightwards to possible single party governments or a return to Centrism by allowing the PLI back into the fold?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020336_DESC;The Rumor II, from the name of Prime Minister Mariano Rumor, is the second government formed by the former DC secretary after the first one fell due to the split of the Unified PSI-PSDI into the PSI and the PSU (United Socialist Party, composed by the former PSDI members). Having the Centre-Left parties agreed to support a single party government as the two new parties solidified, it seems that it has finally come the point to resume coalition talks: will Rumor be able to form a third government unifying the Centre-Left forces, or will Moro be able to strike a deal with the Socialists and Republicans to form a bipartite DC-PSI government that will shift the climate to the left to the disgrace of the PSU, shall the talks stall there is no choice but to call for early elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020337_DESC;Formed after the first early elections of the Republic, the Andreotti Government signed a shift to the right of the ruling DC, but after a diatribe between ministers the frail majority lost her spot in the parliament leading to a crisis. To avoid another call to the polls two options seem to approach, the expansion of the ruling coalition to include the newly founded PSU (Unitary Socialist Party, the former PSDI that has now split from the merger with the PSI) and form a second Andreotti Government, or leave the lead to Amintore Fanfani and a shift to the left with a bipartite DC-PSI coalition with outside support from the Republicans; the situation is very tense and early elections loom around the corner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020338;The political crisis of the ruling DC has reached a dramatic point, early elections have experienced an increase for the PCI that leave no option but dialogue with them. A longtime majority the DC and her allies now find themselves in a relative minority and the only option to a Leftist government headed by the PCI and including a reconciled PSI and PSIUP, is a National Solidarity government with outside support from the PCI that will address the boiling issues of the moment, such as workers' strikes, divorce and the students' contestation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020339_DESC;This year's presidential elections have seen an unlucky turn of events, after various scrutiny Giovanni Leone was finally elected Head of State but only thanks to the support given by neo-fascist MSI. It has been a non-written rule since the beggining of the republic that no law or government shall base itself on the sole support of the MSI and other eversive forces, hence the PRI has retracted its support to the government opening a crisis. Having all Centre-Left parties voiced protests for the elections except for the PSU, only two options come forward with Giulio Andreotti as Prime Minister in both cases, either a single party government that will guide the executive to new early elections or a coalition government between the DC and the PSU with outside support from Liberals, who had been excluded from government for a long time now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020340;This year's elections are going to be held under a climate of fire, the 1968's students movement has matured and the protests turned into terrorism, in the last couple of years terror actions both from the far right and the far left have intensified claiming tens of lives, but a few forces have managed to take advantages of those disasters. The MSI-DN (Italian Social Movement - National Right, name assumed by the MSI after its merger with the PDIUM Monarchists) has managed to display itself as the party of Law and Order and the representatives of a silent majority that will not stand for this violence, increasing their electoral share and excerting pressure on the DC as the left seems to grow unstoppable. Two voices have monopolized the internal debate of the DC, Aldo Moro and Giulio Andreotti, and it seems that any coalition will depend on who triumphs, will Moro's Organic Centre-Left once again manage to conquer the electorate or will Andreotti's forward to the Centre tactic involving a new Centrism composed by the PSDI (That has returned to this name in 1971 after the split) and the PLI?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The conflict arose out of a particular historical situation where L'Aquila has traditionally been the most important city in the region, regional capital under the Bourbons and the Savoys, but under Mussolini's regime the two cities of Castellammare Adriatico and Pescara united to form a big industrial center that in the post-war surpassed L'Aquila for inhabitants and became the economic hub of the whole region. After the Regional Government made it clear that L'Aquila as expected was going to become the capital, the citizens of Pescara feeling underrepresented took the streets and rioted, asking for a re-evaluation of the city as regional capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020343_DESC;Regional capital since the times of the Normans with only little interruptions during the centuries, the city of Reggio di Calabria entered a period of hard turmoil after the announcement of Catanzaro as regional capital. Outraged by the establishment the citizens of Reggio started a real urban guerilla in the streets of the city, constituiting civil committees and recurring to violence with the police, in some instances even thanks to the help of the local mafia, 'Ndrangheta. Initially a cause brought about by the whole spectrum except for the PCI, the revolt quickly got coopted by neofascist MSI, that under the regional leadership of Fortunato Aloi and trade unionist Ciccio Franco, has managed to take hegemony over the movement, ressurecting even slogans from Mussolini's regime such as "Boia chi molla", alienating moderates. As the committees only get more violent, voices in Rome have been suggesting to deploy the army to restore order amidsts a situation of chaos in a Region that has already been devastated by emigration and mafia wars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020344_DESC;On the 22 of July $YEAR$, amidst the Reggio revolt and a series of bombings throughout the whole region, a train went off-rails killing 6 and injurying more than 70. The cause of the derailment can be found in the so called "Black Terrorism" aka far right terrorism (black from Mussolini's Blackshirts) that has been rapidly claiming lives throughout the whole peninsula since the Piazza Fontana Massacre in 1969.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020345_DESC;"Operation Tora Tora" or has it has been named by the news, Golpe Borghese, from Junio Valerio Borghese, former Fascist Naval Commander and President of the MSI between 1951 and 1953, of aristocratic origins and coup leader, was a coup attempt that took place during the night of the 7th and 8th of December $YEAR$. Planned since 1969 with the support of extra-parliamentary neo-fascist groups such as Avanguardia nazionale and Fronte Nazionale with support from various sectors of the Army and the Police Force, the Coup projected to eliminate the communist threat in the peninsula, managed to organize a solid plan also thanks to the links established with organized crime such as Cosa Nostra and freemason lodges such as P2, with tacit support from the US Embassy, which greenlighted the operation after various meetings. Borghese's plan was to use those militants and army sectors to seize RAI (the national broadcasting company) headquarters, enter the interior and defence's ministries, kidnap the sitting President of the Republic Giuseppe Saragat and forcefully disband the parliament with the use of the police. During the night the cities of Milan and Rome saw vivid action but past midnight Borghese received a call suggesting to abort the coup. Will the situation escalate or will this mysterious call, whom many suspect to come from Giulio Andreotti himself, as he had been keeping in contact with the ringleaders, convince the Black Prince to shut the Operation down?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
