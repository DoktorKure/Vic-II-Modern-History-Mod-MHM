human_immunocontraception_desc;Immunocontraception, the process of utilizing an animal's immune system to prevent pregnancy or impregnation, has long been studied in nature. For decades the application to human contraception remained far-off, with concerns over safety, reversibility, and the method of transfer being debated issues among scientists. However, recently breakthroughs in medical science have allowed a method that has been deemed safe enough for wide-spread human use - ushering in a new and more potent form of contraception.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

landfill_mining_desc;Landfill mining and reclamation or LFMR, is a process designed to reclaim land used by landfills via the extraction, processing, and sorting of the solid waste materials in them. This has two major benefits - one being the restoration of land for potential future agricultural use and the other being the recovery of several valuable materials that are able to be recycled for future use. ;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
jet_pack;SRLD;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
jet_pack_desc;Since the jet-pack was first invented by Soviet scientist Alexander Andreev in 1919, it has captured the attention of fellow inventors, militaries, futurists, and artists alike for the possibilities it has presented. However, it is only recently that it has become viable as a practical tool and more than simply a curiosity used for small demonstrations or entertainment. \n\n With recent advances and optimizations to its design, the jet-pack has finally exited from science fiction and into military reality. Already this new 'Small Rocket Lift Device' has found application for use in reconnaissance, amphibious assaults, naval boarding, and to generally increase the maneuverability and adaptability of infantry ground forces.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
