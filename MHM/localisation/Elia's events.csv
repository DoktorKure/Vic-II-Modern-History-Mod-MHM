EVT_8020346_DESC;On the path of Pescara and Reggio, L'Aquila has also took the streets protesting the decision from the regional junta to share the regional capital between Pescara and L'Aquila. The revolt started during the junta's sitting, in which as soon as the motion was pushed forward, coins started being thrown to the speaker, bringing the junta to announce the session paused even tho it was actually finished and had passed. Out of the building a mass of people booed the politicians and on the following day city strike was called, the strike quickly got violent, destroying the party Headquarter of all institutional parties except for the MSI and the house of the city mayor was taken assault. On the third day tensions dissipated as PCI's Pietro Ingrao held a speech in the city calling for unity, but the issue is still hot and further parliamentary acts will have a crucial role.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020347_DESC;The recently formed Centrist government has entered a crisis following minister's Giovanni Gioia (DC) decision to ban private cable TV. The decision came after a long period of discussion about TV. Since the limited introduction of colour TV, the mediatic question has been the major argument in the chambers. First clashes came when minister Gioia representing the ruling DC announced that, after a period of testing, colour TV will be introduced nationwide, while PSDI ministers pushed for the new technology to be used only for important events as the PCI lead a campaign against the introduction, deeming it a useless consumer good, and the PSI backed the DC. Later developments pushed the Communications' Minister to ban private TV to ensure a regulated introduction. This move has proved itself controversial, gaining critics from PSI's Bettino Craxi and prompting the PRI to threaten to withdraw confidence to the government if Gioia isn't sacked. If we don't stand back it is very likely that the President of the Republic will inquire Mariano Rumor to form a quadripartite government with the Centre-Left formula, either Prime Minister Andreotti can sack Gioia and integrate the PRI into the ruling coalition, assigning them the Communication's Ministry. Sectors on the right also push for a controversial move, change the PRI for the MSI-DN, and secure a Centre-Right government standing on their controversial support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020348_DESC;Following the formation of the latest Andreotti government, the Prime Minister has had to resign from his place citing the protests from within the party and the ruling coalition, with the PSDI withdrawing support when MSI-DN's votes turned decisive in the last parliamentary meeting. Forced to abdicate, Andreotti is far from having left the arena, with the help of DC veteran Guido Gonella, he has been vying within the party to play the factions to secure a single party government headed by Gonella and with outsider support from the PLI and the MSI-DN, maintaining the Centre-Right shift. Shall he fail in this task it is very likely that Moro and Fanfani's factions will be able to instate the "organic" Centre-Left with Rumor at its head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020349;Coming off a troubled legislature, this year's elections, finally a regular one, lay their destiny in the hands of the PSI. The leadership of the Socialist Party, having long abandoned the projects of unification with the PSDI, has to take a vital decision as no majority will be able to be formed without their support. Will the Socialists shake once again hands with Berlinguer and the PCI, forming a Left Alternative, or will the PSI manage to sway the DC to their cause forming a left of centre coalition that will be able to enact quick policies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020350_DESC;After having succeeded Rumor at the lead of the Centre-Left, Aldo Moro has managed to lead two governments this legislature, keeping at bay PSI's ambitions. Lately the uneasy compromise has broken up following PSI's Secretary Francesco de Martino decision to withdraw support wanting early elections. Under his leadership the PSI has been vying to closer collaboration with the PCI and trying to make it backtrack from its "Historic Compromise" strategy, mending the 1956 split. An option to avoid this event has luckily presented, Prime Minister Moro, the man behind the "Historic Compromise", could form a single party government with outsider support from the PSDI, PLI and PRI, re-launching Centrism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020351;As PSI's De Martino cuts the head of a chaotic legislature, the medias keep their eye on PCI's Chairman Enrico Berlinguer. The political forces of the whole spectrum have acknowledged the continued growth of the PCI and decided that the time had finally come to come to terms with this italian anomaly. Two options arise, the Historic Compromise and the Left Alternative. To most a Historic Compromise sounds like the most obvious choice, former PM ALdo Moro and Berlinguer have been keeping in contact for a long time and the National Convention of the DC gave the greenlight on his strategy, that would bring the PCI into the constitutional arc and set the basis for a Grand Coalition based on the german model. PCI's Hardliners and the PSI on the other side hope for a change in strategy that will finally bring the PCI and the PSI once again together and finally in power, putting an end to decades of DC rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The train was traveling from Rome to Munich; having left Florence about 45 minutes earlier, it was approaching the end of the long San Benedetto Val di Sambro tunnel under the Apennines.

The bomb had been planted by neo-fascist Ordine Nero (Black Order) as a revenge for the killing of one of their members by left wing terrorists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020353;Held in Berlin, at the Interhotel Stadt Berlin, after months of delay, the Conference of Communist and Workers Parties of Europe, signed a turn in the world communist movement. The Soviet CPSU had been pushing for years for the meeting to help strengthen the movement and their position in the world but the conference only helped its weakening. What was meant to be a reconciliation meeting turned into the manifesto of a new communist left, the so called Eurocommunism, a development of marxism in Western Europe adapted to the current liberal-democratic order, spearheaded by Spain's PCE, France's PCF and with Italy's PCI at its helm. During the Conference Finland's SKP, Sweden's VPK, San Marino's PCS and Great Britain's CPGB joined the Eurocommunist camp, while ruling SKJ and PCR, respectively from Socialist Yugoslavia and Romania, also showed sympathies for the anti-Soviet camp. The meeting officialized the position PCF's George Marchais, PCE's Santiago Carrillo and Italy's Enrico Berlinguer had been formulating through various conferences and official visits, beggining Europe's new reformist turn in the communist movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020354_DESC;What the PCI has been fearing since the disarmament of the Garibaldi Brigades in 1945 has finally happened, as soon as they democratically got into power a chain of command with links throughout the military and the secret services has activated to stop communists' road to power. Troops have already mobilized, but luckily the PCI benefits from infilitration into a few key institutions and genuine popular support, the coup leaders will not take power without a fight. Nonetheless the PCI also benefits from a secret paramilitary organization that had been trained with SOviet support to resist situations like this, the paramilitary oganization has also been instructed to protect communist leadership and activists by arranging safe trips to Moscow, where those exiles will be welcomed by the PCSU's brotherly arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020355;The no compromise line taken by both the DC and the PCI has proved itself disastrous, after 55 days hostage and several police searches, Aldo Moro's body has been found with 12 shots on the back in a car in Via Caetani, exactly on he road that from Piazza del Gesù (Where the DC Headquarters lay) leads to Via delle Botteghe Oscure (Where the PCI Headquarters lay). The death of 61 years old stateman signs a black day in the history of this republic and a turning point in her politics, with Moro gone the Historic Compromise will hardly be respected under the gegemony of Giulio Andreotti, factional rival of the deceased, who is seen by many people as the archtect behind this kidnapping.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020356;The PSI's appeal to negotiations has proven victorious, after having paid an egregious sum of money, the Red Brigades have released Aldo Moro on the outskirts of Rome, where an exchange was mediated by the armed forces. The statesman has now been greeted by the family and the citizenry that has gathered in the city centre to celebrate the release.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020357_DESC;Backlash against the Historic Compromise has surged within the ruling DC after the death of Aldo Moro. Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti has angered the PCI by allowing anti-Compromise ministers into his government and as the nation mourns this national tragedy the PCI has found itself eager to have a role in this governement and threatens to lead the country to early elections if they don't get integrated into the current government. The situation seems clear, either a Grand Coalition lead by Andreotti supported by most constitutional arc parties, or early elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020358;After Andreotti's refusal to allow ministries to the Communists, the nation has found itself facing early elections. The electorate seems to favour the "secular parties" (PSDI, PLI, PRI) over the traditional forces, that for many are comsidered the cause of Aldo Moro's death. The failure of the Historic Compromise has left the DC and the PCI in a situation of crisis and the gamechanger seems that will lay in those third parties. Necessarily the PSI will have to take part in the government, but will the 'secular parties' be strong enough on their own to close the PSI to the position of an outside supporter or will they triumph over those parties and give legitimacy to the former Organic Centre-Left?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020359;The failure of the Centre-Left has lead to a rightwards shift in the public opinion that has scared many on the left. The boiling topic of this election is the MSI-DN, will they provide a useful ally or will that cause national uproar? The DC can only expect to outcomes, shall the MSI-DN prove itself a democratic force an "Organic" Centre-Right will find its road to power, will they not, many sectors within the ruling DC have been arguing for a renewed Centrism in the vein of the 1950's Centrism but with more partecipation from the 'secular parties' (PSDI, PLI, PRI).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_80203060_DESC;9 Years after the 1968's protests, the student's contestation has found a new path. What has been described as the '77 Movement has quickly gained the media's attention. Following the 1969 education reform, University has become accessible for all classes and what used to be a upper middle class movement has turned into a popular movement, animated by the lower stratas of the population. The '77 Movement is characterized by their allegiance to non-parliamentary politics, mainly on the field of the far-left, represented by organizations such as Lotta Continua (Continued Struggle) and Autonomia Operaia (Worker's Autonomy), a new form of feminism and violence in their protests, that has often turned into terrorism.

The police seems to follow the line of a terror attack, waitimg for rivendications and searching for explosive devices on the plane, while rumors from the Quirinale hint that the plane may have been destroyed during a dogfight between Libyan, French and American jets, probably during a punitive expedition against Libyan Ras Muhammar Gaddafi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020362_DESC;After 35 days of strike by blue collar workers at the FIAT Mirafiore factory in Turin, a mass of 12.000 white and blue collar workers took the streets to protest against the strikers, who made it impossible for them to go to work. Entered history as the march of the 40.000 due to journals early reporting, the underlying causes can be found in the firing of 14.000 workers by the company, that had been living a profound crisis since the 70's. The trade-unions quickly came in help to the striking workers and the PCI made it a personal battle, with prominent members and even the leader Enrico Berlinguer visiting the workers and holding speeches, but after a month of inactivity the burden of the strike begun to show its effects and with politiciaztion by government parties, a counter-protest was indicted by a citizens' committee in support of the workers that want to work. This is the first great blow to the PCI's hegemony over he working class throughout the 70's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020363_DESC;As the PSI closed its 42th congress the situation has finally matured to allow them to join the government without reserves. The DC's left wing and Prime Minister Francesco Cossiga see this as an occasion to enlarge the government's position and wish to see a second mandate for the PM, but Andreotti's right-wing faction seeks to not alienate the recently re-alligned PLI and instead vye for a new Centrist coalition that will include all the secular parties blocking off the PSI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020364_DESC;Following a police raid at Licio Gelli's Villa Wanda and Giole factory in the Arezzo province, in Tuscany, during an anti-mafia operation, a list of over 1000 incripts to the Freemason Lodge Propaganda 2 (shortened to P2) was found. The list included many relevant public figures an politicians, among them PSI's Minister for Foreign Trade Enrico Manca and DC's Labour Minister, names of important enterpreneurs such as Silvio Berlusconi and generals like Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa and Vito Miceli (who also was a deputy for MSI-DN) but even former king Umberto I's son Vittorio Emmanuele. Alongside the list were found tapes of interviews to lodge leader Gelli about what was called the Plan of Democratic Rebirth, a conspirative draft for the reforms to enact in order to control Italy. Following the revelations a parliamentary and legal inquiry led by former catholic partisan Tina Anselmi was formed and now the government has entered a crisis due to the ties found with the lodge. President Pertini and much of the parliament wish to see Forlani gone to avoid any controversy, and according to the late president a situation arises to leave for the first time the prime ministership to a non Christian Democratic politicians. Sandro Pertini, a PSI member, has long tried to break the DC hegemony, going as far as handling an explorative mandate to republican Ugo la Malfa in 1979, and today another republican was considered, Giovanni Spadolini. But a few voices within the ruling DC and PSDI have been arguing for the formation of a new Forlani government with the exclusion of the indicted ministers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020365_DESC;The Second Spadolini Government, or as the media dubbed it the "Photocopy Government", recently entered a crisis due to the personal fight between the Treasure and the Finance Ministers. The government came to be after the fall of the First Spadolini Government, the first lead by a republican and by a non-DC politician, due to the right sector of the DC striking down a few reforms, but the PRI quickly managed to form a new government consisting of the same majority and with the same ministers, hence photocopy, after meetings with the DC. The fight, commonly known as "Lite delle Comari" (The gossip fight), erupted when the two ministers, PSI's Rino Formica and DC's Beniamino Andreatta, found themselves disagreeing on the handling of the separation of the Bank of Italy and the national treasure. The mutual separation had been proceeding with no interference from the parliament and the Spadolini govermnet had long been damaged by this, but the situation reached critical levels when answering to Formica's plans to reimburse quotas of the treasure through an extra-judicial pact with the Bank, lead by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Andreatta called the socialist minister and his party "nationalsocialists". This accusation disturbed the whole political spectre, as nazism is still a fresh memory for most italians and many in the PSI even fought in the resistance, and quickly lead to more personal insults. Ultimately the parties of the two ministers have took the stance to not take part in any government where those ministers are present. Two situations arise, Spadolini could lead a third government with new ministers, but the political establishment pushes for DC veteran Amintore Fanfani to lead a comrpomise government that can mend the conflicts between the parties, as Spadolini clearly proved himself unable to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020366_DESC;Since the fall of Spadolini II a uneasy atmosphere has been plaguing the ruling majority, with Bettino Craxi's PSI having grown decisive and determinated to premiership. At their last party meeting, the socialists decided to send the country to early elections by withdrawing their support from the current ruling coalition. Taking advantage of the new political climate and the victories in parliament of his party, Craxi believes that he can lead the party to be the first socialist Prime Minister in the history of the country, but there is a factor he hasn't considered, rising DC star Ciriaco De Mita. Currently the general secretary of the Party, De Mita is a proponent of the Historic Compromise, tending to appease the PCI and seek their help over the PSI's. Shall he be able to strike a deal with the Communist Central Committee, a centrist government supported by the PCI's outside support might be able to save the country from early elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020367;Having succeeded in his goal, PSI's Bettino Craxi now leads the negotations table at the general elections. It is clear that every government will have to include the socialists, but two options arise, one on the left and one on the right. The socialist leader seems to favor an alliance with the DC, PSDI, PLI and PRI, maintaining the Pentapartito formula inaugurated by the Spadolini government, where the socialists would be able to get premiership and lead the nation until the next elections. On the left instead the PCI, after having dropped the Historic Compromise due to its failure after Aldo Moro's death, has been pushing a new strategy of Democratic Alternative, a leftist coalition including all progressive forces within the country, among them the hard left DP (Proletarian Democracy), a party born out of all the social movements arose in 1968 and 1977.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020368;As elections approach two possible coalitions open up for the ruling DC, both on the vein of the revent right wing shift. On one side there is the New Centrist formula, where the "secular parties" will have a bigger share of power, or the Organic Centre-Right with the participation of MSI-DN.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020369;Highly anticipated, this year's elections will prove themselves decisive for the course of the new decade. The voters will be called to the ballots to express their judgement on the Historic Compromise, and if the results turn out positive for the PCI and the DC the second phase of the pact will finally begin, with PCI's full entrance into the government coalition and the country's parliamentary politics, crowning Enrico Berlinguer as the most influential man in republican history. Shall the voters express disappointment, it is possible that the DC will seek a renewd Centre-Left agreement with the socialists and the secular parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020370;The end of the first non-DC lead legislature has finally come and elections approach. The DC has been lacerated by internal fights since Spadolini first held premiership and now De Mita and the party establishment have found themselves at odds. The party's General Secretary wants to renew the Historic Compromise with the PCI, taking advantage of the shift of balance of powers in Italian society and sidelining factions to the right and to the left; but many within the White Whale (Nickname for the DC) wish to give the Republicans another chance, using their leadership as an excuse to gain hegemony over the various factionalisms, by forming a government with the other secular centrist forces and sidelining the PSI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020371;On the 14th of February $YEAR$, hence the nickname Saint Valentine's, Prime Minister Bettino Craxi promulgated a decree cutting the sliding wage scale short of three points to face the economic crisis begun in the 70's. The sliding wage scale was a system negotiated by the trade unions in 1945 and fully expanded in 1975 thanks to the effort of the CGIL, CISL, UIL Federation that ensured the workers the ability to negotiate their wages on a fair ground and based on global economic changes. The decree signs the second setback of the worker's movement since the 40,000 march of 1980 and can be identified with a larger movement of reflux into public life and to the right that has marked the turn of the decade. Although the decree is a law as of now, the parliament will have to approve it or it will decay after 60 days, will the decree be turned in a law-decree the PCI has swore to lead a protracted campaign for its abrogation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020372_DESC;Following the approval of the Saint Valentine's Law-Decree, the CGIL, CISL, UIL Federation has broken down due to the secret deals striked by the CISL and UIL with the government regarding the sliding wage scale and the CGIL's opposition to the government's maneuvre. This signs another big defeat for the worker's movement as the Federation had came to be following the Hot Autumn of 1969 and for more than a decade represented the united will of the working class, that today finds itself fractured just as it did in the immediate post-war, when the CISL and UIL split from the then hegemonic CGIL.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020373;As expected the PCI pushed forward a motion for an abrogative referendum on the Saint Valentine's Law-Decree. Now that the referendum has to be held all the responsibility rests on the voter, who, if they shall vote no to the abrogation, will show to the PCI that their time is soon to be over. The PCI has in fact put a lot of pressure and energy into this project and shall they loose it would be a huge blow to their public image and electoral performances, but on the other side that would be a huge victory for the PSI and its leader Bettino Craxi, who has set himself the goal to reform italian society bottom-up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020374_DESC;Having lost the $YEAR$'s Abrogative Referendum on the Saint Valentine's Law-Decree, PSI's leader Bettino Craxi has had little to do but resign from his position as Prime Minister, hoping for the president to dissolve the chambers and calling early elections to find  anew guide for the country, but DC's new charismatic leader has been considering the formation of a coalition with the PCI in the vein of the Historic Compromise until the end of the regular legislature. What will happen in either case cannot be predicted, the only thing that can be known for sure is that Craxi and his new Socialist Party will need years to regain the momentum they had managed to gain before those tragic results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020375;Following defeat at the ballots during $YEAR$'s Abrogative Referendum on the Saint Valentine's Law-Decree, PSI's leader Bettino Craxi resigned from his premiership and the president Sandro Pertini dissolved the chambers calling early elections. The absolute defeat of Craxi's reformists has paved the way for the rise of the PCI and the return of the Historic Compromise: the two most possible outcomes seem indeed a DC-PCI Grand Coalition in the vein of the Historic Compromise or PSI's eclipse from parliamentary politics will be able to open the path for Andreotti's Centrist cabinet, thanks to the exodus of votes from the PSI to the secular parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020376;Between the 13th and 16th of October $YEAR$ the local juntas of Turin, Pescara and Rome shut down the transmission from Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest channels Canale 5, Italia 1 and Reete 4. According to the magistrates the private company was streaming illegally by using video tapes to which the state had not given authorization. Following the judges' actions, Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, a friend of Berlusconi, quickly drafted three decrees (Berlusconi first, bis and ter) to make the streaming legal once again. Needing prime minister's decree the parliament approval or else they decay after 60 days, the parliament will have to decide if the measures will stay leaving the road open for private media or if to reimpose state control over transmissions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020377;On the 7th of June $YEAR$, PCI's Chairman Enrico Berlinguer, as he was holding a speech in the city of Padova ahead of the incoming European Elections, was hit by a stroke, but neverthless continued to address the rally while the people there kept asking him to stop. Soon he was brought to his hotel room where he fell asleep on the bed and entered a coma, just to die in hospital on the 11th. On the 13th of June the funeral was held in the city of Rome, attended by over a million people and many relevant public figures such as President of the Republic Sandro Pertini and even MSI's leaders Giorgio Almirante and Pino Romuladi, ideologically opposed to the late PCI leader. The procession started in Via delle Botteghe Oscure, where the PCI headquarters lay, and went on to San Giovanni Square, showing the support the city had always had for the chairman. Shortly after his death Alessandro Natta, a longtime ally of Berlinguer, was elected as leader of the Italian Communist Party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020378_DESC;The first socialist-lead goverment in the history of the republic has recently fallen due to various contesting issues between the DC and the PSI. It has reached public attention that in 1983 prior to the elections the DC and the PSI had found an agreement, the so called relay agreement, that would guarantee that for in exchange for a PSI Prime Minister, a DC Prime Minister would take over halfway during the legislature, to then renew the pact during the next elections. Craxi has on his part not showed any willingness to respect the agreement and the DC answered by not voting in favour of the PM's last decrees. The pact those is far from having been forgotten and Craxi could be able to gain some more time to enact it negotiating with the DC's Right-Wing of Andreotti, while De Mita and the rest of the party hope on the pact to be respected and a new Fanfani govenrment to lead the nation until the end of the legislature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020379_DESC;As Craxi managed to hold on one more year, the tensions within the Pentapartito have really reached te boiling point and the DC will not accept one more socialist government. If Craxi won't fall in line to the pacts there will be little to do but call early elections, in that instance the DC has already consulted the other parties for the formation of an electoral government under Amintore Fanfani that can deal with the bureaucratic issues until the chambers are officially dissolved. If PSI's inner contesting voices will though be able to make themselves be listened by their leader, there is hope that the relay agreement will be respected and Arnaldo Forlani will cleanily succeed Bettino Craxi as head of the Pentapartito.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020380;As expected Fanfani managed to prepare the country for elections just before having had his government fail at the confidence vote, which ironically saw full support by the PSI, PSDI and PR (Radical Party) and opposition by the DC that voted in block against. The new President Francesco Cossiga could do little but dissolve the chambers and call early elections, the first that will expect a vast number of non-traditional parties enter parliament. In fact the Federation of Green Lists and the Lombard League, respectively an environmentalist and an autonomist movements, are expected to enter the two chambers while the Radicals are expected to grow their consent. Nonetheless the DC is expected to still come out on top while the PCI to loose to the PSI, who under Craxi's premiership largely increased their electoral successes. If everything goes as polls show, the only thing left to the future is who shall come on top of this new edition of the Pentapartito, that is assured to get a majority. The main contenders are Giovanni Goria representing the leftist factions of the DC and Giulio Andreotti for the right, only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020381;The first season of the Pentapartito has come to its end as the legislature closes and the polls show great successes for this new political formula. Having the relay pact been respected by Craxi's socialists, now the negotiations between the five ruling parties have begun ahead of the new electoral successes. Some argue for the first half of the legislature to be continued by the DC and that seems the most likely outcome but PSI and PRI leaders have been voicing their opinions asking for a new term in their hands, to then give the premiership once again to the christian democrats by the end of the legislature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020382;During the Paris Peace Treaties negotiation a clause for which it was ensured that Italy should have never really had resources independence was added. The clause also assured that Britain would have kept a monopoly in the Mediterranean, but since Enrico Mattei was made administrator of italian ENI, this balance has been upset. Enrico Mattei's policies have angered many at the pentagon with his firm opposition to what he calls the "seven sisters", the 7 biggest oil trusts in the world, including our Standard Oil of New Jersey, Mobil, Chevron, Gulf and Texaco and his closeness to third worl liberation movements. Under his influence Italy has moved dangerously close to the Arab states, which it financed publically and risks not only to sabotage our economic interests in the region but even to slip out of our sphere. After a quick meeting with the british MI6 officials it has been agreed that this man has to go, but to do so a presidential approval is needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020383;The start of the Six Days War between Israeli and Arab-Egyptian forces has started a great debate in our ruling cabinet. Under the influence of Enrico Mattei and his third world enterprises, foreign minister Amintore Fanfani has long been pursuing, both as PM and as minister, a pro-Arab policy, in defiance to NATO official politicians. This pro-Arab policy has been dubbed by the White Whale (The DC) as neo-Atlanticism, aka the support of Arab states to keep them away from sliding into Soviet hegemony, but renewed conflict and american support for the israelis has lead to a turning point. If we want to keep pursuing this neo-Atlantic policy there is no choice but to withdraw from NATO and pursue an independent foreign policy while not cutting diplomatic nor economic ties with the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020385;The time has finally come to pass the premiership once again to the DC, but it will not be as easy as expected. The DC has been undergoing factional struggles ahead of the relay and once again the left and right factions have come on top, on one side Giovanni Goria, a member of the young generation of the party, on the other Giulio Andreotti, longtime factional leader and former prime minister. So before any decision shall be taken, various rounds of consultation between the parties and even more among the factions shall take place to allow the relay pact to come into effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020386_DESC;The De Mita Government, formed after the fall of the first Goria Government that fell due to already resolved issues between the coalition members, has recently been attacked by Bettino Craxi's PSI, that after his re-confirmation as party leader in the last PSI Congress, has formed a pact with DC rightist leaders Arnaldo Forlani and Giulio Andreotti to bring down De Mita and his faction. The pact which in the media has been dubbed CAF (Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani), is set to bring to power Giulio Andreotti in exchange for a later possible PSI premiership, while isolating the centrist and leftist factions of the DC. Only one alternative seems to arise, as proposed by PSI's third in command Rino Formica, a possible National Unity Government headed by compromise figure Oscar Luigi Scalfaro that will use the PCI to counterbalance the socialists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020387;Following a historical victory in the last elections, the PCI has decided to take the zeitgeist and enlarge the ruling coalition by turning the Left Alternative into a Democratic ALternative, that can include even more democratic forces. The PCI is planning on ruling again alongside the PSI and with the new support of DP (Proletarian Democracy), representing the branches of the population to the left of the PCI, but hopes to be able to include regionalist and more moderate elements to be able to bring about better results. But while the PCI is confident of its strength, the PSI might turn of them if the polls don't show broad support for the former goverment, and could break the process of re-unification by forming yet another alliance with the DC and the Centre-Left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020388;As a result of the recent economic policies the Italian GDP has reached a historical high, surpassing the UK in what has been called "il Sorpasso" (the surpassing). Italy has such benefited from becoming the 6th economic power on the world stage and the 5th in the capitalist block behind the US, Japan, West Germany and France, enjoying more international prestige brought by the "Made in Italy" mark and a second italian miracle. After the stagflation of the 70's Italy has finally seen a new golden age, social life has returned to good levels and citizens have never been as rich, it is truly a good time to be italians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020389;Today voters will be called to the polls for a new general election. This year the hottest issue is the renewal of the Historic Compromise, will the PCI and DC renewed path together be approved by the voters, or will they flock to third parties, re-inforcing the Right DC opinion of the need for a New Centrism, closing the Historic Compromise window and return to their traditional allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020390;A new electoral season inaugurated by the Right's successes has opened and a new player joined the game. The MSI-DN and the PLI, after recent collaboration, have decided to initiate a confederational experiment, in what they call the Right Cartel. Alongside rightist elements of the DC, this new political element, that will take the name of DN (National Right), has decided to came down to agreements with the DC to allow for one of its members, Raffaele Costa, to become the new prime minister shall the voters wish so. But to this proposal a counter-proposal has arisen among christian democrat more moderare voice, that will try to form a coalition of Centre-Left parties to counter this experiment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020391;After a long political journey begun in 1989 with the XVIIIth Congress of the Italian Communist Party and that ends today with the XXth Congress, the PCI has entered a new phase and abandoned its historical role as a marxist party, changing emblem and becoming the Democratic Party of the Left. After a long period of decadence begun with the 40.000 march at the turn of the last decade that saw costant decline in polls and failure in various referendum and law proposal, the PCI, under its new leader Achille Occhetto, a member of the younger generation of the party, has decided to embrance the position of a social-democratic party that could, alongside the PSI, constituite a great left wing, democratic and european opposition in the parliament. The reformist turn had initiated after the XVIIIth Congress and the Bolognina turn of 1989, when chairman Occhetto spoke of a "New PCI". A great debate has since ensured among the party ranks, between who supported the turn and who supported the heriatage of the PCI and wished to maintain it, tensions exacerbated during the preparations of the XIXth Congress, when supporters begun to publically harass reformist leaders and blocked communications through the PCI hotline phone number. Although the voter's resistance at the congress 67% of the Party voted in favour of the change, prompting many to leave. The last straw is happening right now, as the Occhetto motion wins at the XXth Congress and the Cossutta motion (in favour of the old PCI) leaves the party to found a new marxist formation, the Communist Refoundation Party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020392;This year's election are set to take place in a very different situation from any previous election since 1948. Since the start of the Mani Pulite pool investigations, the public opinion has greatly turned against traditional parties and new forces are set to make great advances. Lega Nord, a broad coalition of regionalist and federalist regional leagues, including the Lombard and Venetian Leagues that in 1987 entered parliament, and La Rete (The Network, whose full name is Movement for Democracy - The Network), a progressive movement born out from the Sicilian DC with a great emphasis on combating mafia, have rapidly been making gains respectively in the north and in the south of the country. As if it wasn't enough the Pentapartito fell down after the inauguration of Giulio Andreotti and at the polls this years presents itself a smaller Quadripartito composed by the DC, PSDI, PLI and PSI, since the PRI left the coalition over a fight of ministries. Although the Quadripartito seems to be the most likely option a smaller faction of the DC headed by Mariotto Segni, son of former Head of State Antonio Segni, is bringing forth the possibility of a technocratic goverment to enact fast reforms in the country, supported by the DC, the PSDI, the PLI, the PSI, the PRI and La Rete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020393_DESC;The victory of the Mattarellum, long fought against by the socialists, at the $YEAR$ Abrogative Referendum have left little to do for Prime Minister Giuliano Amato but to accept the defeat and resign. Considering the recent political instability given by a series of scandal brought about by the Mani Pulite pool, a tacit agreement between most political forces, from the Quadripartito to PDS' former communists, the FdV (Federation of the Greens) to the PRI and AD (Democratic Alliance), has found its way among the parliament, hinting of a possible technic's government headed by former Bank of Italy leader Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, which would also entail many non-politicians among its ministries, to enact quick reforms. On the other side an unlikely coalition kept together by PSI's Bettino Craxi, who has recently lead a charge against the government trying to get the premiership back, has been trying to form within the parliament. Craxi has managed to get under his umbrella the secular parties (PSDI, PLI and PRI), Bossi's Lega Nord, La Rete, FdV and even the neofascist MSI-DN in hope of restructuring this country, but this coalition's success lays on the bet that a few tens of DC members will abstain from voting against.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020394_DESC;Having been sworn in by less than 10 hours, the Ciampi goverment faces already great responsibilities, the process of socialist leader Bettino Craxi. Antonio Di Pietro, leader of the Mani Pulite pool, has recently asked the parliament to remove Craxi's parliamentary immunity to have him attend a process against him and his party, accused of embezzlement and corruption. The goverment and the parliament are now set to vote on whetever to authorize the pool or not, and the PDS and the FdV have already threatened that if the vote will save Craxi, they'd withdraw support from the government, ending their short collaboration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020395_DESC;Due to the political instability of the current republic and how the current electoral system has proved itself inefficient in giving fast answers to actual issues, a referendum on a new voting law was indicted by Mariotto Segni's Democratic Alliance and Pannella's Radical Party. In conformation to italian law the referendum will only be able to abolish the current law, while the new one would have to be approved by the parliament at a later date. The new electoral law, which was dubbed as "Mattarellum", from the name of its theorizer Sergio Mattarella, but that for many deserves the nickname "Minotaur" for its chimeric form, will change the chambers costitution by turning 75% of the constituencies from Proportional to First Past the Post, while in the senate the remaining 25% will be assigned through the scorporo, a mechanism for which the most voted non elected members would get a seat, while in the chamber of deputies the 25% will be assigned through a classic proportional system. The law will also include an electoral threshold of 4% of the votes, whereas earlier you needed 300.000 votes. Against the Referendum only Craxi's PSI and the MSI have took a solid stance, while most of the parliament has supported the initiative or remained apathetic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020396;On the 17th of February $YEAR$, in Milan, judge Antonio Di Pietro, after having obtained a mandate, arrested PSI's member Mario Chiesa as he was trasportig a kickback for public work given by enterpreneur Luca Magni (Who was the one who denounced Chiesa, sick from paying the politician). Chiesa was caught thanks to a hidden microphone hidden in Mafni's jacket and as soon as the news became nationwide PSI Leader Bettino Craxi, who was campaigning for the incoming elections, denounced the case as an isolated one, and called Chiesa a villain. After a few turns of interrogations Chiesa confessed that the kickback had become a tax needed to participate in any government and that all government parties, including the PSI, were full into the corruption system, contradicting Craxi's declaration. With the help of Chiesa's wife the Mani Pulite pool (Clean hands pool), the pool that leads the case headed by Di Pietro, has found the names of other corrupted politicians, and from them other names and so on. With many politicians getting indicted trust in the parties has been reaching historical law levels, with Di Pietro being hailed as a hero, the Dc shrugging off the investigations, Lega riding the wave to gain more votes and Craxi denouncing the judge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020397_DESC;The victory of the Mattarellum, long fought against by the socialists, at the $YEAR$ Abrogative Referendum have left little to do for Prime Minister Giuliano Amato but to accept the defeat and resign. According to the pacts signed by the Right DC and the PSI an easy transition to Christian Democratic rule under Arnaldo Forlani shouldn't be a hard task, but on the other side of the parliament an unlikely coalition headed by Bettino Craxi, who has recently lead a charge against the government trying to get the premiership back, threatens the Quadripartito and the CAF. Craxi, defying the earlier agreements, could manage to get under his umbrella the secular parties (PSDI, PLI and PRI), Bossi's Lega Nord, La Rete, FdV and even the neofascist MSI-DN in hope of restructuring this country, but that will rely on tens of DC members abstaining from voting against the new goverment. The future of the country is in the hands of Craxi, who shall decide whetever to stick to the pacts or force his hand into a new coalition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020398_DESC;As the Tangentopoli scandal ravages the country, the use of illegal funds to finance the secret services has came to public attention and threatened the government as Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi defended the President of the Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro when he was asked to resign. Unluckily now Ciampi is under fire and all parties have turned against him, prompting for a quick solution to the issue. Many seem to wish for a round of early elections, so to unlock the blocked legislature to the changes caused by recent political instability, but on the other hand, Mariotto Segni, who in the meanwhile has left the DC to found his own Patto Segni (Segni Pact, shorthand for National Rebirth Pact), has proposed to lead a coalition of DC, PSDI, PLI, PRI, his own party and the Lega Nord to quickly enact reforms to fix the current situation of the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020399;The first to be held with the new electoral system, this year's elections mark the end of what has been called the First Republic, and the beginning of a second republic. For the first time we see an election marked by the establishment of two different coalitions running against eachother similiarly to how it plays out in the USA or the UK. The forerunner are on the left Achille Occhetto, former leader of the PCI, the architect behind its transformation into the PDS (Democratic Party of the Left) and the current leader of the Alliance of Progressives and of the PDS. The Alliance of Progressives is a left wing broad front formed by 8 parties: the PDS at its head, the PRC (Communist Refoundation Party, usually shortened to just Refoundation), a political party born from the ashes of the former PCI by members who refused to accept the dissolution of the party, the Social Christians, a humanist and left wing splinter of the former DC (Which has recently become the Italian People's Party, PPI for short), the FdV greens, La Rete, a much smaller PSI and its splinter RS (Socialist Rebirth). On the other side of the spectrum we find instead enterpreneur Silvio Berlusconi, who thanks to a small trick, has managed to form a strong front on the Right. Berlusconi was candidated as its leader by two different coalitions, the Pole of Freedom and the Good Government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020400;The voters will today once again be called to the ballots to decide the fate of their country. The options seem once again to burn down on the PCI or the Centre-Left as government allies for the ruling DC.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020401;Due to the series of victories by the PCI, this year's elections seem to propose a degree of polarization never seen before. The PCI is once again running on a Democratic Alternative platform alongside the PSI and the DP, but the Right has revently been making comebacks and to avoid this outcome the DC has had little to do but to firm a Centre-Right coalition with the PLI and the MSI-DN.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020402;Another elections round approaches and once again the PCI is running on its Democratic Alternative platform with PSI and DP, but the centrist forces, under the umbrella of the DC, have found once again unity, hoping to stop the successes of the communists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020403;Today voters are called to the polls to decide whetever to give the Government the ability to amend the constitution to enact the reform drafts recently shown to the public. The voters will vote on the sinle issues, deciding where to give the government confidence, in the first constitutional referendum ever held in the country. The Referendum includes three motions, each regarding a different sector of the reforms: Motion 1 regards the new administrative asset pushed forward by the PCI and regionalist parties, Motion 2 regards healthcare and benefits from the support of the PCI, PSI, DP, PR and PSDI while Motion 3 regards the chambers and is supported only by the PCI. We shall see if the Communists will be able to solve the contradictions of this Republic or if they will fail like many have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020404;After the historic rightwards turn of the country following last elections, the ruling Centre-Right coalition has suffered great losses due to the student's movement that's been trying to shift the country left and don't tolerate the presence of neo-fascists in the ministries of the Republic. The students have polarized public opinion after various clashes with the police and right wing counter-protestors, and the participation of the MSI's students' wing to these clashes has turned the DC to consult first her former goverment allies, the PSDI, the PLI and the PRI. But shall those consultations end badly there shall be little choice but to hold onto the MSI once again, proceeding in a right direction, but maybe the PSI could come in handy to stop this tide and turn the country back to her anti-fascist roots, forming a Centre-Left coalition as tried in the late 50's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020405;The victory of the Right at last elections has quickly lead to the evolution of the MSI into a new political body. Ahead of today's elections Giorgio Almirante, MSI's leader, has brought under his umbrella the PLI and the PDIUM (Italian Democratic Party of Monarchist Unity, successor of the PDI), beginning what he called the National Right. The unification of those parties into the new MSI-DN signs a new period of the Right Wing in Italy, under Almirante his party has managed to get more relevance among moderates, presenting itself as the vanguard of common sense and order during the chaos of the student's movement. Alongside the DC the new MSI-DN has formed a Cartel of the Right, hoping to restore order, stability and prosperity, but shall the voters be threatened by this outcome, maybe the Centre-Left could really be the only way to achieve such prosperity and stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020406_DESC;As announced in Borghese's appeal to the Nation right after the coup, the first mission of our government is to stop the communist infiltration in and outside the state. The debate within the junta has recently been revolving around the extension of the War on Communism. The most obvious chocie would be to ban all leftist parties, starting from the PCI to the PSI and all the smaller extraparliamentary formations that gravitate towards the two parties, but others suggest to limit the ban only to outright communist formations, keeping the PSI on a grey-scale of legality to please our less involved allies, but the option to go on with an extra-legal fight against leftism has also arisen, keeping the parties legally allowed but leading the fight with the help of illegal means and actors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020407_DESC;As the first steps against the communist threat have been taken, now the question of leadership has arisen. According to the agreements with the US Ambassador to Rome, now it would be the time for Giulio Andreotti, Christian Democratic politician of the first rank that under the new regime has been appointed to the Interior Ministry, to step in and initiate the phase of normalization of the junta, drafting up new institution and preparing new elections free from communism. But Junio Valerio Borghese, the former blackshirt veteran turned generalissimo, and his clique may have other plans in mind now that the country is under their hands, and there is little the US could do to stop this transition to a more authoritarian state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020408;As a condition for our support for the Coup, the Italian regime has pushed forward their support for our current fight in Vietnam in exchange for economic aid. The Italian Republic had long been plagued by debt and during our talks with the Junta we had come to the terms that we could help fix that issue if Borghese and Andreotti were to send a few of their men in Vietnam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020409_DESC;Thanks to the efforts of President Andreotti, we have finally entered the second phase of the new regime, but this second phase has yet to take a final form. The pre-established procedures would suggest a relatively fast transition to democracy, fixing the last issues of the Republic and ensuring free and communist-less elections roughly a year from now, but pressure groups within the Junta have had other ideas. Infamous Freemason Lodge Propaganda 2, which under the leadership of magnate Licio Gelli has taken an active role in the success of this coup, also shares the idea of a return to democracy, but would like to have a say in this re-organization of the country, adapting the state-to-be to the interests of the powerful lobby in a longer process. But a more outlandish idea has also been heard, some of the most anti-Communist members of the goverment have offered Andreotti the position of President-for-Life, and who knows if he will agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020410_DESC;The Second Phase is almost over and now is the time to settle once and for all the question of elections, the initial terms were one year but as time comes closer we might have to postpone it by 3 months calling it in 6, although the original plan could still be followed, marking the end of the second phase in 3 months from now. This is all assuming that the pressure put on President Andreotti could actually backfire and prompt him to cancel the elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020411_DESC;Elections come closer and tensions rise. The part of the Junta that has remained close to Borghese and the Far-Right has now staged a final straw to oppose the democratization of the country. Troops lead by Colonel Borghese and General Miceli have occupied the streets of Rome and it seems that if we want democracy to prevail it will have to come down to the liquidation of those opposition forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020412_DESC;Finally the Second Phase is over and people flock to the polls. Three Coalitions have presented themselves to the voters in the first elections since the Coup. The Democratic Opposition, formed by the PRI, the PSDI and PR's Radicals, includes many relevant critics of the dictatorship, many who have served time in jail for their opposition to the Junta and others who had to migrate, and has presented herself as the only option to keep the democratization going forward. Andreotti's Christian Democracy has also stood in elections alongside the PLI, and after having purged many of the most vocal supporters of the regime, it has tried to re-brand and show herself as a moderate choice to maintain order and reject the junta's excesses. Lastly the National Front, formed by MSI-DN and the smaller AN (National Avanguard) and ON (New Order), has decided to run as an umbrella for supporters of the Junta promising continuity and stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020413_DESC;It is elections season once again and after the historical loss of the Democratic Opposition during the last ones, the climate seems to have favoured the former Junta and today the Democratic Centre seems set to have the upperhand. Both the Democratic Centre and the National Front have in the last years succesfully concluded a modernization effort within their party, to such an extent that many today forget the DC's role in the Junta while the National Front keeps to grow. But not all is yet lost even for the more moderate forces, the voters might surprisingly turn their back to the juntists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020414_DESC;It is once again the time for elections, the third since the restoration of democracy. The ballots give as usual three choices, the Democratic Centre, the National Front and the Democratic Opposition. The best shall win.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020415_DESC;Under initiative from the costituent members of the Democratic Opposition, a motion for the trial of the Junta has recently reached the chambers. While the coalition is united on the trial, this unity falls apart when discussing the actual extension of those trials. Many are worried that a trial of all people involved with the Junta could cause a lack of trained experts in the military and in the state bureaucracy while also fracturing italian society as many families could be affected by the outcomes, so the more moderate voices propose the trial only of key leaders and the worst offenders. On the other hand there is also the risk of the trial motion actully not making it through through the parliament thanks to a united move by the opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020416_DESC;Another initiative launched by the Democratic Opposition has been the re-legalization of banned parties. But even in this motion they have found themselves divided. The Re-Establishment of Democracy was planned with the exclusion of communists from any political discourse, but under the Junta the term communist came to identify any Left-Wing opposition to their rule. Now the key word lays in this same name communist, the parliamentary inquiry, shall their work not be striken down by the opposition in the chambers, is fractured on whetever to include the clause to limit the ban to non-communist parties or not. In any of the outcomes the PSI will return to the ballots thanks to the measures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020417_DESC;It is finally elections season and thanks to the victory of the Democratic Opposition in the last elections much has changed in the political climate. As the PSI returned to legality after years underground, the ruling Democratic Opposition has lost the Radicals to the Left Cartel, the PSI's coalition, and has had to rebrand into the New Centre, proposing itself as the democratic pole for all classes while the DC has once again decided to run with the PLI into the Democratic Centre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020418_DESC;As the third free elections come closer not much has changed in the political climate as the New Centre, the Left Cartel and the Democratic Centre battle their way to power..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020419_DESC;As Andreotti fell to P2 pressures a Committee for Re-organization has been established to give shape to the new Italy. The first task of the Committee will be that of the Socio-Economic situation. The current plan is to give major concessions to foreign capitals to make the return of foreign investments easier, the privatization of all non-obligatory education institutes such as universities and high-schools and to lower tax rates on funds to be re-invested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020420_DESC;It is little secret that the P2 has long been colluded with the Sicilian and Calabrese Mafia and that they have also helped the regime in some of its harshest periods. As the country prepares herself to a democratic administration, the question of how much infuence the Mafia shall have in this new state is up to questions. Should they role be rewarded signing a deal with major Cosa Nostra and 'Ndrangheta clans to secure them a future in the state-administrations, or should they be put apart and liquidated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020421_DESC;As the Re-organization is nearly finished, the Committee has come to address the last touching issue, the form that the new democracy will take. The original P2 draft suggested the establishment of a bi-party FPTP system to favour their system but there is the ones who support a mixed system that would include 75% of the seats being FPTP and the remaining 25% proportional, leading to a system favouring coalitions but that would be harder to influence. Lastly an outlandish idea has also found some supporters among the Committee, the plan to run a partyless democracy where politicians will have to run as independents approved by the Committee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020422_DESC;The efforts made by the goverment to return to democracy have failed as the various pressure groups within the junta have had to rely on Colonel Borghese's forces to end this process. Borghese and other loyal officers have seized the Quirinale under invitation from P2 leader Licio Gelli and other dissident factions who have found the path to democracy unfavourable. The public is outraged but it seems that the Re-organization is officially over and Italy won't see elections for a long time still.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020423_DESC;Everything is set and the Committee for Re-organization has been dissolved, now there is one last issue before elections. The government is wondering how much influence shall the current government have over the future democracy, shall the Re-organization be ended in name only maintaining a close eye on the polls or should we do away with any system to maintain control?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020424_DESC;It is finally the time for the first free elections of the Italian Republic since the coup. As expected the two concurring parties are the PSI, who in the meanwhile has integrated the PRI, PSDI and PR into their ranks and the DC that has been joined by the PLI and the PDIUM to create a bipolar sceanario between the left and the right for the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020425_DESC;It is once again election time and once again the choice is between the PSI and the DC, shall the best win.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020426;After having served the nation since the first elections in 1946, taking part in various governments and lastly becoming president-for-life during the Borghese Coup, Giulio Andreotti has died earlier this mornining in his home in Rome. The President had been sick in the last few months but refused to resign. With his death marks the end of an era, many people have had very varied opinions regarding him, from he deems a saviour to who a spawn of hell, but everyone can agree that he radically changed Italy and made it the country that it is today. The state funerals will be celebrated tomorrow at the presence of Pope Benedict XVIth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020427_DESC;The issue of the Veterans of the Italian Social Republics, those who served under Mussolini during his last days in the National Republican Army, the National Republican Airforce, the National Republican Navy, the National Republican Guard and in the Black Brigades, has long been one of the most dear issues to the MSI and the Italian Far-Right. Borghese himself is part of this category of men, having served in the Xth Mas division of the National Republican Navy, and he has finally decided to address the issue, drafting a plan to pay regular pensions to all those soldiers who had been forgotten after 1945 and re-integrating the younger veterans into the modern army. But not everyone within the Junta thinks that this would work, many think that the re-integration into the army could actually damage the strength of our army that has been developing as an elite force, while these soldiers wouldn't meet the criteria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020428_DESC;Even though we never got our Nuremberg Trials due to the fact that Mussolini and most Fascist leaders had been killed by the partisans, since the defeat in the Second World War and the establishment of the Republic, the figure of Mussolini has been demonized and slandered. As many in our government held the Fascist Era in high regard and some, like Generalissimo Junio Valerio Borghese, have had the pleasure to be personal friends of the Duce, the question of the revaluation of Mussolini has surfaced. Many wish to see just his role in the history of our country revised to reppresent better his rule and maybe restore a few roads named after him, but a just as numerous faction, that includes the Generalissimo, wishes to see an even bigger role for the Duce, presenting him as the Father of the Nation and creating a commission to exalt his rule through statues and public manifestations. Of course a pretty vocal group also opposes the decision as a whole, deeming it ahistorical and revisionist to history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020429_DESC;Having suffered a stroke earlier this year, Generalissimo Junio Valerio Borghese has decided to retire, but not before settling the issue of succession. Four personalities have been selected as possible successors, but only one will be the lucky one. Many speculate that long time friend of Borghese, Stefano delle Chiaje, one of the architects between the coup who has since then played as the regime's protegèe in many foreign countries, building links with the international far right, could be the most likely choice, but Giulio Almirante, Chairman of the MSI who has clung up the regime's ladder, could be at similiar odds for the spot. Coming from a more bureaucratic background, having served also as communication and culture minister under Mussolini, Almirante is seen as a reformer with a focus on european affairs. Vito Miceli, former counter-information services leader and key agent in the coup, is also considered for the position, the only military leader in the bunch. Miceli could though be considered a risky choice as his pro-Arab views could upset Washington, under which he served back during the First Republic. The last choice is Giulio Andreotti, although having lost the powerstruggle to Borghese a long time ago, his influence has no vanished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020430_DESC;As the last dictatorships of Europe have fallen, we have been left alone and the popular resentment has been harder and harder to manage. The days of our regime seem to be ending and many think that the best option is to step down and return to democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020431;Today the dear leader Stefano delle Chiaje has died in his house at the age of 83. Having lead Italy during its harshest times, delle Chiaje died in peace, having succesfully saved Borghese's legacy and turned Italy into a beacon of Anti-Communism. Having been an avid supporter of the cause worldwide, leaders from all over the world are attending his funeral in Caserta, from the French National Front, to the Colombian hinterlands the death of delle Chiaje is being mourned as a great loss for the  international far right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020432;After the fall of the Francoist regime and the Transition to Democracy, our secret services have been in continuous contact with Spanish dissenters, having financed the Guerrilleros de Cristo Rey and other extra-juridical organizations, but now the chance to make a comeback has appeared. After having met Lieutenant Antonio Tejero Molina and Major Ricardo Saenz Ynestrillas in the Cafeteria Galaxia in Madrid, our agents have been able to draft a plan for the return to power of the Falangists. The Operation, which will take the name of Operation Galaxia, from the cafe, relies on the foreign trip of King Juan Carlos to South America, when our men and the forces of Tejero will be able to seize the parliament and proclaim the Transition to Democracy over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020433;Troops lead by Lieutenant Antonio Tejero Molina and Major Ricardo Saenz Ynestrillas have gathered outside the parliament threatening to enter and suspend our Transition to Democracy. The Coup comes as a result of years long Italo-Spanish connections that have smuggled armaments and funds to Far-Right Groups within the nation, asupicating the return to francoist rule. The situation is very tense and if we do not act instantly the situation will swing in favour of the coup plotters as the King finds itself in South America as of now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020434;Tejero and Ynestrillas have been arrested by the Spanish Authorities and their forces dispersed, our collusion with the plotters has also surfaced and our international reputation suffers from that. With Tejero in jail our only choice if we want to keep going on with Operation Galaxia is to take direct military action and send our troops to Spain, staging an invasion from the Mediterranean and quickly restore order to the country, returning rule to Spain's rightful rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020435;Today at 11:24 a JAT Boeing airplane flying on the Titograd-Belgrade Line that was captured by Croatian Terrorists has landed in our Airport in Taranto. The terrorists have asked to meet the Junta Leader Stefano delle Chiaje, wanting to approach him for support in their cause for independence against the Yugoslav government. The terrorists are members of a group that takes inspiration from WWII Ante Pavelic's Ustasha, who our government used to fund, and see in our Nation a perfect ally for the fight against Tito and Yugoslaveism. Indeed the alliance seems a pretty convenient one as since the end of WWII we have been at odds with the Yugoslav communist authorities over the issue of Trieste and Istria, and we could benefit from such an alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020436;Tensions in Yugoslavia have been escalating lately and our ties to the Croatian Resistance seem to be coming handy. A meeting between our Secret Services and Croatian leaders has been arranged in Muggia for the day, just a few kilometers from the Yugoslav borders, and an agreement on the terms for our involvement in the independence and government of Croatia will be discussed. Our diplomats will try to follow two routes, both of which will include the strategical and material support for the nationalist Croatian Defence Forces (HOS) in a coup d'etat to bring the nation under their rule. The goal for our nation is at least to secure the Slovenian city of Capodistria, now called Koper, with the aid of Croatian military, but if the negotiations seem to be favourable enough we may aim at recovering the full of Istria, giving in exchange to Croatia our full involvement in any military conflict to recover their whole national sovereignity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020437_DESC;The Powderkeg of the Balkans have finally erupted, it is our time to to our role and send serious support to the brave croatian fighters. As we had formerly agreed with various nationalist leaders, we hope to give our full support for the Croatian cause against serbdom and communism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020438_DESC;The militias of the Croatian Defence Forces (HOS), which have during the war took a crucial role in the defence of our freedom, have today turned against us, marching on Zagreb and asking for all the power to be shifted from the parliament to the Army, that will take the Nation and bring it together in face of the Serbian aggressor. The Nationalist plotters seem to be colluded with the Italian State and it looks like they have been financed by the delle Chiaje regime. Our newbprn democracy is at risk, we will do our best in these dark times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020439_DESC;Having finally achieved independence and reached the top hierarchies of power, it has come the time to honour our agreements with Italy. We will be sending an envoy to Koper seizing the city later tomorrow and quickly after Italian troops will come in and claim the territory, closing the debt we owe to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020440_DESC;Having finally achieved independence and reached the top hierarchies of power, it has come the time to honour our agreements with Italy. We will be sending an envoy to Koper seizing the city later tomorrow and quickly after Italian troops will come in and claim the territory, closing the debt we owe to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020441_DESC;Giorgio Almirante, the new leader of the Junta and chairman of the Italian Social Movement, has finally addressed the Nation for the first time since he came to power. After a long meeting with ministers and military leaders, Almirante took the Radios to announce a new phase for the Italian Nation. Talking about the progress made in the last years, Almirante officialized what he called "National Renewal", from now on all political assets of the Nation will be focused on the realization of a new society, centered on Work, Family and Nation. The MSI leadership will favor the socialization of the means of production in a long period in which workers will be able to participate in the economy alongside their ceos, and the return of the chamber of corporations, to manage the economic life of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020442_DESC;As according to the regime's National Renewal policy, the first steps in favour of the socialization of the economy will be taken, favoring small business and free enterprise while also empowering the working class the plan will place all major business under a board of management run by the Chamber of Corporations in Rome, composed by selected technics and specialists, who will be able to harmonize society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020443_DESC;Having a long history in the political sphere, ranging from the Ministry of Culture and Communication under the Italian Social Republic to a decades long experience as a deputy for the Italian Republic, dear leader Giorgio Almirante has made himself a reputation of a great diplomat. As proposed by Britain's Oswald Mosley, Amirante among many has embraced the view that Europe shall stand as a united entity made by many nations against east and west. To help this coordination Almirante has proposed to create a Commisssion for European Integration that will deal with our ties to European Far Right Movements, most importantly France's Front Nationale and Belgium's Party of New Forces, but also with the leaderships of Portugal, Spaina and the Greek Junta. Through this commission funds allocation and international relations will be organized and in the next days Almirante will take a tour to most European Countries to campaign for the incoming European Parliament elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020444_DESC;Holding a speech in Trento's main Duomo Square, dear leader Almirante has announced his plans on safeguarding Italian-ness in Italy. Trento is no random place to send a message, the Trentino South Tyrol region has long been at the center of ethnic tensions between the german and italian citizens, and Almirante has decided to call it over, never again shall an Italian feel like a minority in his own country, and has issued a plan to incentivie italian culture in the region and revoke its autonomous status. Almirante hasn't only talked about the german issue, but has also addressed the Istrian question, that since the Paris Peace treaties has been torturing Italy. The MSI and its leadership has in contnuity with their former actions decided to stand for the Italian-ness of the Friuli Region and deicded that no more shall Trieste be subject to International pressure or Communist tricks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020445_DESC;After having implemented the first bases for the socialization of the economy, now the country is finally ready to embrace the Social Market, an answer to the lacks of both capitalist and communist regimes. In the vein of the Verona Manifesto signed by the Mussolini administration in 1944, Italy has found a national way to surpass the market's dichotomy and with those last measures will finally be able to run an efficient modern economy at the services of the nation and its citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020446_DESC;Due to the declining health of the dear leader, Giorgio Almirante turned in resignations to his post as the country's political leader, and will from now on instead assume the role of the cerimonial head of state. But one last issue has to be settled, the issue of succession, from his new position as head of state Almirante will have to appoint a new political leader for the nation, and two options are approaching. On one side War and Party Veteran Mirko Tremaglia, a close friend of Almirante who has recently been serving as Foreign Minister and has since 1968 took on an effort to organize italians world-wide and encourage italian-ness among the diaspora, he has been characterized by many as a reformer who might take the National Renewal further than its original goals. On the other side is Domenico Mennitti, a member of the left-wing of the regime along Pino Rauti, has also been named as a possible successor. Having taken national relevance as the Finance Minister under the National Renewal, Mennitti is seen as a compromise leader for the hardliners, who see in him a reliable figure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020448_DESC;The process of National Renewal has officially been ended as Vito Miceli's hardliners occupied Rome and arrested Tremaglia and other reformist leaders. Tremaglia's leadership has found itself very weak as many of Almirante's plans weren't enacted swiftly and in the appropriate mode, leaving the young leadership unable to overcome the military opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020447;Earlier today the dear leader Domenico Mennitti has died in his sleep at the age of 75. Having preserved Almirante's state and furthered its conquest, Mennitti's rule will be remembered for the consolidation of the Social State and the successes of the Alternative Right in opposition to both Western Capitalism and Eastern Communism, leading Italy and the party into the modern age without loosing any of their character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020449_DESC;Under the New Leadership the country finally approaches the end of the new National Renewal. Under Tremaglia the nation has finally embraced democratic reforms and Italy is now able to become a shining example of an anti-Communist Democracy and an example for rightists everywhere. One last issue though waits the government, as free elections come closer and closer, many wonder if it would be a good idea to maintain our hegemony in the new government, putting our hands here and there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020450_DESC;The first democratic elections since the Coup finally approach and two coalitions are running both for the spot of president and supremacy in the chambers. On one side Mirko Tremaglia and his Italian Social Movement, who on the local level has allied with various minor right wing parties, and that will try to maintain continuation in novelty, while against him and the former junta a coalition lead by the DC and composed by the PSDI, the PLI and the PRI, will take the opposing front denouncing the excesses of the regime and standing for legality. Shall the best win.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020451_DESC;Since the last elections much has changed in the political climate. Tremaglia's MSI has undergone a re-branding and become the National Alliance, moderating its stances and dissociating itself from the right-most factions of the party. The DC has also re-branded after scandals hit the party revealing Andreotti and other DC members' role in the former Junta, leading it to become the Italian People's Party (PPI) and running alongside the PSDI and PRI in the Daisy coalition. A new player has also entered the field, Silvio Berlusconi, a businessman who has rcently decided to enter politics, Berlusconi gained national prominence during the later phases of the National Renewal, when the liberalization of TV stations gave his Fininvest a good monopoly on Italian media. Berlusconi is now running with the PLI, the Radicals and LN northern autonomists in favour of free business and a renewed republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020452_DESC;As usual the National Alliance, the Daisy and Forward Italy will fight a battle to the last vote for the presidentship, shall the best win.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020453_DESC;Croatian troops with Italian strategic support have been sieging the port city of Koper since today's dawn. The attack seems to be part of a broader Italo-Croatian agreement relating to the revent conflicts in the balkans and seriously threatens our independence, cutting off our only port. To fight back seems like a suicide but the only other option is to give up our access to the meditteranean and ethnic slovene land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020454_DESC;The recent Israeli invasion of Lebanon poses us an important question, that of our involvement in the Mediterranean. Our leadership has long expressed pro-Arab views but we have had little to act on it, the blatant Israeli invasion gives us a perfect battlefield where to test our army and where to assert ourselves as a regional power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020455_DESC;Since 1981 Clan feuds within Cosa Nostra, the biggest crime syndicate in Sicily and in the Nation, have been disturbing the life of sicilian citizens in what has been dubbed as the Second Mafia War. The situation in the southern region has become untolerable for its citizens and our administration has to take a stance, General Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa, a leading member of the Army, known for his role in the fight against Terrorism and for his intrumental role in the defeat of the Red Brigades, has volunteered to be appointed as Commissar to the Region, to bring the Mafia to its knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020456;Following the appointment of military men in most government posts under the Miceli regime and the stabilization of the country, the question of a new constitution has arisen. The Military Administration has pushed forward a proposal for this new constitution, cementing the role of the Army and of the Navy through the election of an appointed upper house made up of proffessionals and war heroes, the the merging of civilian and military structures, the institutionalization of military carreerism, the re-introduction of free-press and the normalization of the state of emergency under laxed terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020457_DESC;The failure of the Military Administration to cement its rule through a new constitution has lead to extremists elements of the Junta to be able to lead their way to power. A group of hardliners lead by Gianadelio Maletti, a secret services member close to the NATO establishment and the Mossad, who has been involved in various operations in South Africa, seized government after having out-maneuvred Miceli, who now is under house arrests. The Nation under Maletti will now probably see an Atlantist Right-Wing turn and a re-approachment with the sector of the eversive right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020458_DESC;Having lead the Nation in a New Era after the death of Borghese thanks to the approval of the Military Constitution, Vito Miceli has died today after a very long carreer, from NATO South European COntingencies, to the SID (The Italian Secret Services) and lastly as the Generalissimo of Italy. The Nation is not yet lost though, two generals have been selected by the Junta as possible successors. On one side Amos Spiazzi di Corte Regia, a former fellow of Generalissimo Miceli in the SID and who has had a key role in the Borghese Coup. Spiazzi is seen as the most likely successor, and unlike his rival, he actually benefits from a long political carreer on the monarchist camp, for which he still sympathizes to this day. On the other field Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa, the most loved general in the country, seems to benefit from the approval of the population, who sees him as a moderate contender and a key to a stable society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020459_DESC;Having made no secret of his Monarchist sympathies, Generalissimo Amos Spiazzi has recently entered negotiations with the Savoy House, in particular with Victor Emmanuel, the son of late King Umberto II. Spiazzi and Victor have now been correspondants for a couple of years and the situation seems to have become favourable for the end of the exile imposed on the Royal House in 1948. The return of the Savoys will sign a final pacification with the monarchist side, who since the Referendum has been at odds with our government. Shall we go forward with the operations, the Savoys will take a state trip from their residence in Switzerland to Rome, where they will be greeted by the Generalissimo and taken to a tour of the Eternal City and later to a press conference.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020460;Having long suffered from heart problems, Generalissimo Amos Spiazzi has left us today at the age of 78. The country mourns the leader and a state funeral attended by NATO leadership will take place tomorrow in the morning in Spiazzi's native city, Trieste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020461;At the late age of 87 years, Generalissimo Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa has left us in his sleep earlier this night. Having made himself loved by the lower stratas of the population due to his efforts to fight organized crime and terrorism, dalla Chiesa's funeral is expected to be attended by thousands of people, many collaborators and even more survivors and families of people who have had their life threatened by the mafia. General dalla Chiesa surely will not be forgotten in the history text and his rule remembered as a stable period in Italian history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020462_DESC;To counter the continuous expansion of organized crime in the South of the Country, Generalissimo dalla Chiesa, who has in the past already served in Sicily in a similiar role, has organized a mass operation, nicknamed Operation Sicilian Vespers, to end this problem once and for all. 120.000 troops will be deployed to the regions of Sicily and Calabria, respectively operation zones of Cosa Nostra and 'Ndrangheta, and the civil administration of the regions will be subordinated to a military council, hopeflly this will resolve our problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020465;Failing to pass a law regarding financing to private school, the current government has signed resignations, hoping to resolve the issues of the ruling Centre-Left majority through a new dialogue between the parties. The failure of the law clearly has only been the spark that triggered the powderkeg within the chambers. Indeed the Centre-Left has since its first government found much opposition from non-government parties, some even hoping for a possible coup, and the Right Wing of the DC headed by Antonio Segni has accepted the candidacy of Senate President Cesare Merzagora to propose an alternative to the current government. Grouping the DC and the PLI under a single bi-colour party, with outside support from PDIUM's Monarchists and PRI's Republicans, Merzagora, technically an independent, hopes to form a Centre-Right government to face the issues of our times and resolve a few constitutional issues. On the other hand the DC, PSDI, PSI, PRI coalition might not be as weak as expected and could and most likely will easily settle its issues and come forward with a new executive lead by Aldo Moro and oriented to the Left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020466;As the situation on our eastern border has stabilized following the London Memorandum and Trieste seems back in our fold, the legal status of Friuli-Venezia Giulia can finally be settled. Long home to autonomist sentiments, that sometimes have evolved into separatist parties, the politicial situation is finally ready to settle the question of Autonomy, extending to Friuli the same special status that characterizes Sicily and Trentino-Alto Adige. Although recognizing this autonomy would be greatly appreciated at home, this may anger the Yugoslavs who could see this as an insult to the Peace Treaties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020467_DESC;Today a celebration of the Victory of the Monarchy in the last Referendum organized by the National Democratic Liberal Concentration in Naples in Medina Street led to the killing of 9 people after clashes broke up due to the provocations of the counter-protestors. The counter-protest that had been organized by the PCI and the PSIUP was attacked by a group of young monarchists, leading the police to fire on the crowd. The nation is in shock and tensions don't seem to be dissipating, only God knows what this summer will reserve for Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020468_DESC;On the wave of the Medina Street Massacre tensions have been erupting throughout the whole country over the last few weeks, the PCI mobilized its activists over the killing of civilians during protests in Modena and Cosenza and in other cities the clash turned to day long barricade struggles. The city of Milan echoed the recent war following the attacks of Communist and Socialist militants who were protesting the removal of Communist Mayor and Partisan Ettore Troilo and news are coming that in Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna many veterans have been gathering on the mountains armed. To answer those attacks on the New Order right wing paramilitaries, often with dubious backgrounds, have begun to organize and counter back the social-communists. Our government is considering supporting the efforts of those brave men but the question of legality has been dividing our administration, the many argue for a total war on subversives but more cautious politicians would prefer just cover support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020469_DESC;After months of civil conflicts the situation has reached the point of no return. The PCI and its partisans have grouped with the PSIUP and their partisans to form alongside the Pd'A (Action Party) and the PRI a united front for labour, peace and republic. The catch-all front has taken up the name of Popular Democratic Front and has declared a rival Italian Republic in the 'red' regions of Tuscany, Emilia-Romagna and Umbria, with key control in the souther halves of Lombardy and Piedmont too. Palmiro Togliatti has quickly been elected Prime Minister of the new Republic while republican Carlo Sforza the new President. Now it's the time to take a last stand, shall we fight for Socialism and the Republic or shall we stand with the King?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020470_DESC;As the war drags on our positions have been getting weaker and defections have not been rare, to endure those hardship an unconventional deal might be struck. Earlier during the war the Italian Movement of Social Unity, an organization grouping Fascist veterans, petitioned for the enrollment of former veterans in the National Struggle against Communism. Whereas we would gladly benefit from new and trained soldiers who are motivated to win this war, this decision could backfire on us, no one has yet forgotten the atrocities of the Mussolini Regime and many of those soldiers were until prior to the conflict detained for crimes during the war. The general population could not take well the decision of letting fascists once more roam free and we could see support for the communists rise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020471_DESC;Enterpreneur and President of the AC Napoli Team Achille Lauro has approached our government to offer his help in the war struggle. Coming from a family of dealers and having ammassed enormous wealth during the Fascist regime, Lauro is a convinced anti-Communist and one of the richest many in the country, his fleet is the biggest private commercial fleet in the whole of Italy. We gladly thank Mr. Lauro as the parliament discusses this proposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020472_DESC;Following the victory of monarchists in the Italian Referendum of 1946 the country quickly plunged into chaos and then civil war, with the Communist Party taking leadership over the Republican faction. Shall the republicans win Italy may be very well lost to the Soviets and one more country would fall under Stalin's hands, we should do everything it's possible to help the King win.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020473;As red troops entered the Eternal City papal diplomacy quickly mobilized their ways to move the Pope out of Italy. Pius XII, a longtime anti-Communist, is suspected to be on the hitlist of many partisans and the papal conclave is afraid that his capture could mean the end of the temporal power of the Catholic Church. Pius has left for Naples disguised as a taxi driver and there he will leave first for France and then from there gather international recognition to his cause. The catholics of the whole world pray for the salvation of the Pope and his Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020474;Calm has been restored and so has the Pope. Following the re-conquest of the city of Rome by our brave soldiers and its pacification our government has been mediating the return of the Pope to his seat in the Church of St. Peter. Thousand of catholics have gathered in front of the Vatican hailing the restored Pope and mourning the deaths of the war. The King himself with his family was one of the many attendees of the luxurious celebration. Among those the most prominent are Spain's Generalissimo Francisco Franco, irish Taoiseach Eamon de Valera and brazilian President Getulio Vargas. Shall the Church last a thousand more years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020475;The Red Threat has been defeated, King and Nation have triumphed, freedom has triumphed. The republican authorities have surrendered and although minor battles are still going on we can safely say that it's over. Togliatti and Nenni have run to Moscow and the Constituent Assembly has begun to restart peacetime activities. A bright and democratic future awaits Italy among the western nations. The King will soon address the Nation and marches are scheduled for the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020476;Right after the Victory in the Second Italian Civil War the Constituent Assembly has begun the work on the first constitution of the Kingdom as agreed during the War of Liberation. Since 1848 the Savoyard domains have been subject to the Albertine Statue, a constitutional statue that worked as country's constitution through various emendments, but during the partisan struggle an agreement was made between former king Victor Emmanuel III and the political leaders of the Resistance, establishing the Constituent Assembly that managed the 1946 Referendum, after the Referendum the second task of the assemblyw as to draft a new constitution in line with the current century. After months of work the job has finally be completed and the liberal-democratic forces of our government worked perfectly to propose a progressive constitution that respects the history and the values of Italy. Now it just needs the King's approval and it will enter in effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020477;Having succeeded his father Victor Emmanuel III in 1946 amidsts political instability and violence Umberto II did not receive any formal coronation event. Now that peace has been restored and Victor Emmanuel III is sadly dead the time to arrange a lavish ceremony for the King has finally come. The King has been greeted by the Monarchs of all of Europe, from Britain's George VI to Juliana of the Netherlands, Gustaf V of Sweden, Leopold III of Belgium, Frederick IX of Denmark and Iceland, Haakon VII of Norway, Paul of Greece and even Monaco's Rainier III. Many former monarchs like Michael of Romania, Zog of Albania and little Simeon II of Bulgaria have attended and even Farouk left Egypt to visit Rome. Alongside the monarchs many Head of States have attended. Although the event has been called the start of the Rebirth of Italy, for many detractors of the monarchy the expenditures by the governments have been exagerrated and could actually hurt the reconstruction of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020478;Since having helped us win the War Achille Lauro has quickly rised through the ranks, becoming Mayor of Naples and shaping the culture and landscape of the city. Lauro has become a symbol of the South that stood in the name of the King and Tradition, under his leadership the City has seen a cultural revival, rediscovering her customs and becoming a regional intellectual capital, with many movies being produced there and the citizenry being very active in the institutions. We all thank Lauro and the people of Naples also thank Lauro.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020479;Since ENI has been established, its chairman Enrico Mattei has quickly been pushing his own agenda and using any mean possible to achieve his goals. Not only has ENI expanded to own its own armed forces, but to conclude his deal with the Shahansha he has proposed to King Umberto II to marry off his daughter Maria Gabriella to the Emperor of Persia. This deal is very important, shall Mattei manage to close it Italy would be the first nation to deal oil in Persia outside of the Anglo-American Conglomerate that has been suffocating the nation, this deal could also favor an alliance with the millenary state of Persia and begun our process of an independent foreign policy. On the other hand the King does not so keen on selling off his daughter like she was cattle and family relations could get sour over this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020480;The Millenary Empire of Persia has crumbled to socialists and islamists alike after months of civil strife. Revolutionary forces have quickly seized the government and taken control of many embassies and oil fields, putting at risk our own investments. Escaping this tragedy the Shah of Persia Reza Pahlavi has sought political asylum in our country, being tied to our royal family and a longtime ally. The Shah has already been denied asylum by the United States and fears that many western nations could do the same, dooming him to face the angry revolutionaries, hosting an exiled leader could boost our position in international diplomacy and also pay back the debt owed to the Pahlavis, on the other hand we might anger the new regime and its allies, disturbing our oil policy in the middle east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020481;Tensions between king Umberto II and crownprince Victor Emmanuel have been a costant since his teenage, when the king had to have the army supervise him, but now they have reached a boiling point. It has emerged that in January 1970 prince Victor Emmanuel and his fiance Marina Doria have married through civilian rite in Las Vegas. Umberto has never liked Marina Doria, for she was the daughter of an industrialist with no noble blood and for her skiing carreer. The prince now wants a religious marriage to be arranged and confirm the former, but according to the laws of the House of Savoy any dynatic marriage needs the approval of the head of the House, Umberto, who has already been denouncing the marriage. This is a very bad day for the Savoys and their reputation, prince Victor Emmanuel has been ruining the face of the Monarchy in the eyes of the public and Umberto doesn't seem to want anything to do with this. Shall he proceed with the marriage without an approval of the King-Father he shall be excluded alongside his future kids from succession, but shall the two come to terms Umberto could secure himself a linear succession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020482;Having served his country and people all his life, king Umberto II has died in his sleep. The death of the king marks the end of an era, as the leader who lead Italy out of fascism and into the democratic west he will not be forgotten, but with his death we see also the emergence of a new generation, younger and less attached to the past. Now we can only mourn and see what the future awaits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020483;As Victor Emmanuel was excluded from succession, since the death of Umberto II Amedeo of Savoy-Aosta has been proclaimed king, and now it's finally the time for his coronation. Amedeo is the son of Aimone, also known as Tomislav II during his brief rule of Croatia, the poster boy of fascist propaganda, and is going to be the first leader of Italy to not come from the main branch of the House of Savoy but from its cadet branch of Aosta. Although having a troubling familiar past Amedeo has long been one of the main spokespersons of the former King, having represented Italy and Umberto at many international conferences and to many countries. Having a past in the navy Amedeo has always been close to the West and we expect a calm and peaceful decades to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020484;Having reconciliated with his father Victor Emmanuel will soon be crowned king of Italy as Victor Emmanuel IV. Since the marriage with Marina Doria was recognized by Umberto relations between the two begun to get better and now the young king can claim to be his undisputed successor. Prosperous decades await our Nation and Victor Emmanuel IV will lead us through those with the best of his skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020485;Our time has come, the forces of the Popular Democratic Front that fight for freedom, democracy, peace and labour have come together Now it's the time to carry on the tasks of the War of National Liberation, mobilizing workers, peasants and all partisans alike, it's a crucial struggle for the future of our country and the leaders of the republican movement have finally proclaimed the Italian Provisional Republic. In these very ours not only are the lower stratas of the population being organized but the nationalization of controlled industries and the redistribution of land has already begun. The Garibaldi Brigades, the Justice and Freedom Brigades, the Matteotti Brigades, the Mazzini Brigades and smaller autonomous fighting formations have been liquidated and merged into a single Popular Republican Army. Now it's the time for change, down with fascism, down with the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020486;After the outrageous results of the 1946 Referendum on the Monarchy in Italy, our comrades in the PCI have had little to do but to resort to armed struggle. The progressive forces of the italian peninsula have rallied behind the banner of the Republic and are waging a war of liberation. With the costant threat of Anglo-American reaction and intervention it might be in our interests to funnel funds and materials to the italian resistance, securing a good ally in the mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020487;The King and his fascist collaborateurs have been defeated, the vast majority of the country is under our control. The escape of King Umberto II to Portugal has widely been considered an official surrender and the current cabinet is relocating to Rome to set up the new Republic. General Secretary and Prime Minister Palmiro Togliatti has gathered alongside other major leaders in Rome to proclaim the triumph of democracy and anti-fascism to the masses. The people are celebrating everywhere and this is truly a great time for Italy, finally the nation has freed itself from all oppressors and can lead herself into the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020488_DESC;Marshall Tito has recently approached our government to offer his help. Collaboration between Italian and Yugoslav partisans dates back to World War II and for quite some time the Communist Brigades located in Friuli directly received orders from the Slovenian section of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Marshall Tito proposes that belgrade could funnel a substantial ammount of economic and military aid in exchange for the abandonment of Gorizia. If we accept the deal, our troops in the North East would quietly help the takeover of the region by the Yugoslavs, while Tito and his troops would also march on Triest, breaking the agreed occupation zones. This is a very riskious move that has split the ruling government, republicans and socialists are deeply opposed to the secession of any italian territory while the communists strongly favour this decision, which has also been pushed by Moscow. It is true that in this very period we need all the help we can gather but for many this could be a humiliation and we also risk the intervention from the United States in Triest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020489_DESC;As Italy is being ravaged by a civil war and our relations with the PCI have soured due to the situation in Moscow, a group of generals in Belgrade has drafted a plan for an intervention in the conflict. Friuli has long been inhabitated by a cospicuous slovenian minority and while we failed to reach our brethren in the region during World War II, we may come in their help in this very moment. A few battalions would be dispatched to seize Gorz, while a stronger bulk of the army would march on Triest, breaking the internationally agreed occupation zones and escalating tensions with the west.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020490_DESC;As part of a greater battle plan Yugoslav Communist Forces have entered Triest breaking the internationally agreed occupation zones and frontiers. The Government of Tito claims to have taken the mantle of regional administrator of the Triest Free Territory but we all know that they only plan on annexing those lands for their own good. We have seen hundred of thousand of italians flee Yugoslavia in the last couple of years and we can't imagine how worse the situation could get shall they get Triest and Gorizia. On the other hand a military intervention could be very costly and unpopular, weakening our position in this emerging world order, it is now in the hand of the President to decide the fate of the italians of Istria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020491;The succession of Amedeo to the throne has not been welcomed by Victor Emmanuel, the son of Umberto, who has gathered a number of supporters and 'legittimists' who believe it is his right to be the new king. Having gathered outside of the Basilica of Superga, the century old family church of the Savoys, he has been giving speeches in condemnation of Amedeo and in support of his own claim, going on tirades about the past of the House of Savoy and the greatness of its legacy. We don't know the echo those words will have and how many supporters does Victor Emmanuel have, but this is surely a serious inconvenience for the new king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020492;Victor Emmanuel has recently been found guilty of participating in an illicit worldwide gun trade. The former prince, who has already been stripped of his royal titles after his Superga speech where he proclaimed himself King of Italy during the coronation of the actual king Amedeo, has been discovered to be involved in a worldwide gun trafficking scandal that may or not may not include people such as the Shah of Persia and different middle eastern top officials. Victor Emmanuel worked as a dealer for the sold of guns in countries subjected to embargoes and it seems that he had also been enmassing some on his own to prepare a possible coup. The former prince is facing the maximum sentence in Italy for his crimes but the question of territoriality has arisen, he could be extradited to France, as the fictious firm he used to make his shady business is registered there, where he would face an even harsher sentence, shall italian courts extradite him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020493;At the age of 78 king Amedeo has left us after a heart failure. Amedeo was the first of his family to rule over Italy. The Savoy-Aosta, who have their roots in Amedeo I of Spain, the minor brother of king Umberto I of Italy who had been elected King of Spain by grace of the parliament, have long been known for their eccentricity, Emanuele Filiberto, grandfather of the deceased Amedeo, was one of the most important generals of the First World War and later an avid supporter of Mussolini while his two sons Amedeo and Aimone were known for their heroism and charm with women. Despite this familiar past Amedeo was instead a serious king and a moderate that was able to manage the dynastical succession in the best of the ways, despite the resistance of his cousin Victor Emmanuel. Amedeo was a big enjoyer of cinema and had a gardening hobby, having even opened his own wine brand. His son Aimone, who is set to succeed him will be opening the funeral ceremony, where guests from all of Europe will be coming to mourn the later king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020494;After Amedeo died his son Aimone acted as King and now it's the time for his formal coronation. Aimone who was born in 1967 has up until the death of his father been an active diplomat for the italian monarchy worldwide and a succesful businessman, he managed the Savoy Royal Estates, including his father's winery and has been living between Turin and Moscow for the last 30 years. Indeed Aimone has been a diplomat to Moscow, helping the spread of italian business to the lands east of the Dniepr. Now he is expected to be an eccellent ruler and the crowning ceremony will be attended by most monarchs of Europe, but not only, in a surprising turn of events the heirs of the last king of the Two Sicilies will also be taking part in the celebrations, marking an important moment of reconciliation in italian history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020495_DESC;Peace has returned but now the battle is being fought in parliament. The Pd'A (Action Party) has unilaterally withdrawn from the Popular Democratic Front citing disagreements with the front's leadership and disapproval of PCI's intimidatory tactics as causes of the split. The 'Azionisti' as the members of the Pd'A are called, were the last remnants of italian pre-WWII liberal tradition, a group of liberal socialists as they called themselves, who have been active in the resistance since the Leggi Fascistissime. This is the first sign of weakness between the coalition of democratic forces since 1922. The withdrawal of moderate and liberal elements from the front signify the growing predominance of the Communist Party over its ranks and many believe this is the prelude of one party rule, but only time can tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020496;Today is a big day, the first free elections since 1922 are going to be held. The voters are going to be presented with mainly two lists, the Popular Democratic Front, headed by Palmiro Togliatti's PCI, the PSIUP, the PRI the PCS (Christian Socialist Party) and many other smaller left wing organizations who have became relevant during the War of National Liberation and the subsequent Civil War, and the opposition, which is not an actual united list but more of an informal agreement between the Pd'A and other parties in disagreement with the ruling coalition to form a government that can stop the Social-Communists. The ballots are ready and whoever is going to win these elections will leave a big mark on Italian History and finally open a new chapter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020497;Six prominent figures of the resistance have recently been called to answer the charges of treason. Giuseppe Saragat, Ludovico d'Aragona, Ugo Guido Mondolfo, Angelica Balabanoff, Giuseppe Emanuele Modigliani and Paolo Treves, who, except for the first two, have all jewish roots. These intellectuals and partisans who have been involved in the fight against fascism since 1922 have been accused of being western spies, zionists, trotskysts, turatists and counter-revolutionaires plotting to re-store the King and break the efforts by our government to collectivize the land and the factories. This trial comes after months of frictions between the ruling Popular Democratic Front and the adoption of the Zhdanovshchina by all Communist Parties worldwide. These six men and women were indeed brought to court thanks to the combined action of the NKVD and our agents. Whatever the outcome of this trial shall be this is a turn of tides in the history of the young Italian Republic, signifying a downwrds trend towards the loss of civil and political freedoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020498;As social-communist control of the country is firm, the new and first italian constitution is finally ready to be promulgated. The legal body that has been informally dubbed the "Togliatti Constitution" will abolish the provisional status of the republic and turn it into a people's democracy by the name of Italian People's Republic, under the guidance of the front. The constitution sets the objectives of socialism, world peace and cooperation as primary goals of the italian state and outlines various measures to secure the rights of all citizens and in particular in the workplace. For the first time in our history the charter also safeguards the rights of women and their partecipation in the political and economic life of the country, making it an obstensively progressive document.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020499;After the resignation of the first communist prime minister Umberto Terracini the President needs now to assign the role to a new man who can form a solid majority in government, the first choice having won the election is of course the social-communist coalition. The PCI itself has asked for a new mandate lead by Togliatti himself and demanding a more strictly communist cabinet which would centralize most power in the hands of communists and prune out the prior independent ministers, but maintaining the positions of the PRI and the PSI from the old cabinet. Some elements of the DC have been trying to convince President Einaudi on the other hand to form a moderate government that could get the outside support of the PSI to stop the communist rise and rally the opposition behind the figure of father Dossetti, a prominent figure within all catholics and very close to the instances of the PSI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020500;The Togliatti government has quickly been able to anger various factions of the army and the police force tied to the USA and NATO. Prior to the 1948 elections the OSS managed to funnel hundred of guns to the DC and the Police to defend themselves in the possibility of Communist victory, well the victory came and so the guns are now being used. Carabinieri and Police are currently seizing key government facilities in the biggest cities of the whole peninsula while the army brigades that are taking part in the coup move in the countryside. General Secretary and Prime Minister Togliatti is asking the people to take up arms and resist this assault on democracy while the corps still loyal to the government and partisans try to re-install government control in the occupied facilities. This is now a fight between democracy and western reaction, we shall see who will come out on top.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020501;Thanks to the support shown by the italian people and our brave partymen democracy and anti-fascism have triumphed, fighting back the elements of reaction. To avoid any similiar incident in the future the parliament has drafted some key constitutional amendments that would be able to avoid the repetition of these events and secure the social-communist government. The amendments have informally been nicknamed the "Togliatti Constitution", it seems indeed that the FDP's proposed changes go far beyond the scope of fixes and propose instead what seems like a brand new document, very akin to the one seen on the other side of the Iron Curtain, with the outlining of the goal of socialism and world peace and the cementification of front rule. Now those changes are up in a referendum that shall be by itself a referendum on the work of the social-communist government, many already lament the set-up of the referendum to be unfree, with partisan troops involved in the ballots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020502;As President Einaudi refused to accept the resignation of Terracini, protests and strikes organized by the PCI have popped up throughout the whole peninsula, destabilizing the country and its economy. It seems that now there is little to do but to accept those resignations and form a new government, but the question is, what govenrment shall follow? Three possibilities arise, Togliatti personally has been seeking a government lead by him and including the PSI, that would exclude the former FDP allies and bring the country closer to his own hands, but there is also the possibility that such a government may not find trust in the parliament and his plans for domination will be ostracized by an uneasy coalition with moderate republican forces such as the PRI the Christian Socialists and the sardinian autonomists of the PSd'Az. A braver proposal has also arisen, Antonio Segni has been designated by the opposition as the man that could save the country from communism leading a full DC government with the outside support of most of the parliament to implement special laws and stop communist infiltration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020503;State power has finally come back under our control but now we need to end the social-communist threat once and for all. The debate has mostly been moving around whetever to make only examples of the FDP leaders for inciting rebellion and treason or if to go all out with a red scare firing any card carrying member from government job and providing public lists of frontist sympathizers that could have their carreer ruined. This is a very important choice for the stability of the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020504;General Secretary Togliatti has recently received an offer from Stalin himself to be the Chairman of the Cominform, the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties. This is a very important role that would on the other hand take up a lot of time from his role as leader of Italy. In the eventuality that Togliatti shall accept this position has head of the european communist movement a General Secretary-in-pectore shall be picked to substitute him in his absence. This figure has been identified in Pietro Secchia, a hardline communistn who has been right handman of Togliatti since the resistance and an excellent partisan leader, he will act as head of government of the Republic until Togliatti's term as Cominform Chairman come to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020505;The Party has recently come under humiliation by the defection to the West of Giulio "Nino" Seniga, the personal secretary of Pietro Secchia. Seniga while defecting brought with him a staircase full of reserved documents regarding our intelligence and party apparatus. This has brought under suspicion the whole clique that revolved around Secchia and Secchia himself, who the party in an extraordinaty session will vote on whetever to expell or not, alongside his followers. No one could have seen this coming from such a vivid supporter of the revolution and the general trust around the hardline bolshevik has been dropping seriously after having long been thought the most likely successor of Togliatti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020506;Following the XXth Congress of the CPSU in Moscow the echoes of the "secret speech" against Stalin and his crimes have reached Italy, setting the party on chaos. General Secretary Palmiro Togliatti, one of the closest friends of Stalin while he was alive and trusted follower of his doctrines, has called on a congress to quell the spirits and address the situation. Having been close to Khrushchev during his rise, Togliatti is expected to follow the line and start a wave of de-stalinization, renaming streets, squares and removing statues, but we may never know if he will backtrack on the last events and re-confirm his longtime friendship with Stalin despite pressures from Moscow, it is true that during the last couple of years of the man of steel, his relations with the italian leader had begun to deteriorate and tensions to arise, especially regarding the future of the communist movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020573;Similiar to what happened in Moscow with their "Anti-Party Group" opposing any attempt at de-stalinization, a local version of the hardliner clique has formed, also taking the name of "Anti-Party Group", spearheaded by Pietro Secchia, the former right hand of Togliatti and resistance leader. This group started during the current party meeting a surprise vote on the chairmanship of Togliatti, to be passed on to Secchia. Togliatti has been accused of fallimentary leadership in the political and economic field, with his agrarian reform vividly under fire, he has also been discredited by the group for the condemnation of Stalin and his legacy. The coupplotters don't have a majority in the Central Committee and the success of this operation lays in the hand of the army, that filled with former partisans, has remained close to Secchia the whole time. We shall see how this develop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020507;In a surpising turn of events the leadership of the PSIUP has decided to break with the PCI over the events in Hungary. Nenni and his clique within the PSIUP have voiced harsh protests over the soviet intervention in the Hungarian Revolution and have quickly decided to bring their party out of the Popular Democratic Front. To the unilater decision of Nenni a minority faction headed by Lelio Basso has decided to split from the PSIUP as the PSI (Italian Socialist Party) and re-enter the Front. Our government is now considering to disband the front and re-organize it as the Anti-Fascist Front for Peace, Socialism and Democracy, expanding the mass organization and changing its rank-and-file. The question of the PSIUP has instead been less easy, with factions calling for the total liquidation through a ban of the PSIUP in favour of the PSI and those prefering to force our hands into a reconciliation between the two socialist parties pruning the most vocal opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020508_DESC;As outlined in the Bucharest Conference of Representatives of Communist and Workers Parties of last June, now it is time to host in Moscow an International Meeting to address the divergences between the CPSU and the CCP. Our Party is participating with a delegation lead by Togliatti and it is rumored that he will try to talk Khrushchev into pacification with Mao. General Secretary Togliatti has been very concerned with the latest developments between the two biggest socialist nations and has taken the matter into his own hands theorizing a theory of polycentrism, where a united communist bloc would be characterized by its multipolarity and collective decision making. Whetever Togliatti will voice his theories at the soviet and chinese delegations we don't know, but this might eb a start for a detente in a period of such ideological heat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020509_DESC;As a part of the International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties, General Secretary of the PCI Palmiro Togliatti has come to Moscow representing his country and party. Recently after the scheduled meeting he has reached out for the General Secretary to discuss the Sino-Soviet Split. Togliatti made a strong case for the de-escalation of sino-soviet relations, citing the fracturing of hegemonic communism as a big loss for the workers of all countries. Togliatti has brought forward what he dubs the theory of polycentrism, consisting in the establishment of a brotherly socialist bloc that must stand united despite its internal differences through an international body with no prevailing power over it, this of course undermines our hegemony over the communist movement, but it is true that we might try to act in a less paternalistic way towards Mao and the CCP, developing instead a policy of mutual cooperation in spite of minor ideological differences, if we are to hear the Italian leader we should instantly call a new meeting with the chinese and try to find a middle ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020510_DESC;The Soviet Union has shrugged off General Secretary Togliatti's cry for unity and thus we are left in a precarious situation. How shall we act from now on? Shall we just give it up and give it in to Moscow or should we put our chances into Mao and the CCP? There is also the possibility of taking distances from both sides and maintaining a balanced foreign policy that would also allow us to restart dialogue with Tito and his people, who could come in handy after their re-approachment with the soviets to mediate a neutral position similiar to that of Ho Chi Minh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020511;During the capture of Rome the Pope and Cardinald flew to France to escape capture or repercussion by communist forces. Now that he has been in exile for a couple of years the effects are starting to show. Our popularity with the catholics is always very low and in some regions of the south the Church is actively acting against our government. It has appeared that to deal with the issue of the Pope and his follower we may need a Bureau for Religious Affairs, that could manage the already existing Christian Movement for Peace and the Organization of Anti-Fascist Priests, two front organizations for catholics and priests alike, but that most of all can mediate our relations with the Holy See in exile and particularly with the weakest links of the Conclave. To entertain in secret relations with the Holy See means to be able to get a better ground for the return of the Pope to the Vatican and the partecipation of catholics in the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020512;The new Pope John XXIII has, in a historic choice, decided to return to Italy. John XXIII, born Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli was elected shortly after the death Pius XII, the hardcore anti-Communist that fled during the civil war. Pope Roncalli has always been a moderate and a reformist and his election by the conclave in exile instantly opened the way for a reconciliation between our two factions. Our diplomats and spies caught the chance and instantly started secret talks with the Holy See for a safe return for the Pope to Rome. Now John XXIII is hailed in Rome by believers that have gatehred in front of the Church of St. Peter right before the scheduled meeting with the General Secretary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020513;Pope Pius XII has recently died and a conclave has been called to elect a new Pope. Pius XII had till his death opposed the establishment of the Italian People's Republic and declared himself a prisoner in the Vatican. Despite this opposition we managed in the last few years to build connections with a few cardinals that may turn useful in this very moment. Given the position of our government we could use our connections and our pressure from the city of Rome to push a friendly candidate to the papacy. Our interference if rightly managed could gain us more support from the catholics, but shall our involvement be discovered the backlash could be huge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020514;Pope Leo XIV has been elected by the papal conclave at its 7th meeting. Leo was the man indicated by our secret services to be most fit for the job and his election signifies a great success for our covert operations. Pope Leo is expeced to show more leniency to the regime and to overwrite some of the most limitative encyclicas of Pius XII. While the election of this "red" pope has been welcomed by italians and the communist authorities, abroad he does not seem to be engaging in such popularity, with american catholics voicing serious concerns about the papacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020515;Insider news from the conclave indicate that voting patterns are not going to favour our candidate. It is debated that the situation may need our intervention. We could force our hands paying off a few cardinals and making threats on others to swing the elections, but we will first need to be able to snuggle our agents into the very closed conclave, which is by itself a very riskious operation. Some unorthodox party members are also suggesting that if the situation keeps going against us we may have to militarily intervene in the conclave, dissolving it and shocking the whole world. We have very little time for decisions and we must be careful in considering the pros and the cons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020516;General Secretary Palmiro Togliatti died of stroke at the age of 71 earlier this night at the Policlinico Gemelli hospital in Rome where he had been staying for the past few days. The death of Togliatti has shook the nation, with his wise leadership he lead the country out of the war and into a new prosperous era and even got the nickname of "il Migliore", the best, for his merits. Having become General Secretary in 1938, he has lead the PCI in its fiercest battles and now the people cry his death. Togliatti wasn't only a well liked figure at home but also internationally, he was a functionary of the Communist International and a personal friend of Stalin. Leaders from all the Eastern Bloc have reached Rome to mourn the death of the late General Secretary, with some also prolonging their stay to assist the PCI party congress that will be taking place after the funeral.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020517;The XIth Congress of the PCI has opened and it is the first since the foundation of the party to not have Togliatti in its committee. Now the various party factions are fending themselves off over the leadership of the country. After the death of Togliatti Luigi Longo, a charismatic moderate very close to the chairman, took over functions as acting party leader following the known procedures. It is very likely that Longo may be confirmed chairman at the congress as his position is the closest to the one of Togliatti and he is a man that could very well mediate the dissent between the other two factions, the supporters of Amendola and those of Ingrao. Giorgio Amendola is one of the most prominent figures of the resistance active in Latium and he represents the reformist wing of the party, aiming at a more "frontist" policy and a hint at detente. Amendola is also very tied to the Legacoop and his election may bring very much power to this planning body. On the opposing faction we have Pietro Ingrao, another man from Latium who positions himself as a leftist, favoring a heterodox marxist position that tries to bring the workers closer to political and state power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020518;The XIth Congress of the PCI has opened and it is the first since the foundation of the party to not have Togliatti in its committee. The fight for the leadership of Italy seems to have narrowed down to two people, Leonilde "Nilde" Iotti and Luigi Longo. Longo has been the acting general secretary since the death of Togliatti and he is seen as a moderate man within the party, a true successor to Togliatti's politics. Nilde Iotti instead is the second wife of the deceased leader, having met during the partisan struggle they only managed to actually marry under the People's Republic. The position of Nilde Iotti is a peculiar one, politically she is not far from Longo but on the diplomatic side, where she excels, she has been very close to the CCP and Mao following the split among the Communist Bloc and it is clear she will bring Italy into the Chinese fold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020519;The XIth Congress of the PCI has opened and it is the first since the foundation of the party to not have Togliatti in its committee. The fight for the leadership of Italy seems to have narrowed down to two people, Leonilde "Nilde" Iotti and Pietro Secchia. Nilde Iotti, the second wife of the deceased chairman, is set to bring forward the polyedric policies of her husband, but not without her own touch, she has been a long proponent of an independent foreign policy within the Communist Bloc and at home she is expected to tow a line between a conservative and reformist stance. Although Iotti seems to be the most likely candidate to succeed Togliatti, the former vice-secretary Pietro Secchia could pose a threat to her election. Secchia has been the most hardcore voice within the PCI since the partisan struggle and his line has often been described as anti-Revisionist and bolshevik.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020520;Togliatti has been stuck in Bucharest due to Cominform work for more than a year now, it is the prime opportunity to cement our rule in the country. If we want to keep ruling the country even in the eventual return of Togliatti, we must act now with a purge, but to what extent? Some argue for the demotion and expulsion of key followers of the former leader while other want to go after all sympathizers in italian society, so to prevent any possible powerbase for the restoration of Togliatti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020521;The latest developments within the Communist and non-Communist World and the sudden shift of goals towards Europe from Asia have made the role of the Cominform superflous. It has been agreed that that the change in world politics calls for the dissolution of the Information Bureau and the formation of a new kind of organization better at dealing with global developments. The Cominform is outdated and never was able to address the crisis it faced properly, it is time to go away with this remnant of stalinist policies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020522;Following the dissolution of the Cominform Togliatti has decided to return home and is soon expected to land at the Fiumicino Airport in Rome. Togliatti expects a warm welcome, full of felicitations and to be soon hailed back as General Secretary, but the reality might be colder. While he surely will receive all the honours of the return his prospectives of power will have to be ridimensioned. It is very unlikely he will be restored but under the example of Moscow we will most likely procede with a collective leadership, where General Secretary Secchia will continue his job as Prime Minister and Chairman while Togliatti will get the honour of being President of the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020523;The uneasy collective leadership has come to an end as Togliatti has moved his supporters in the Plenum of the Central Committee of the PCI against General Secretary Secchia. It seems that Togliatti and his supporters might have the numbers to overthrow Secchia all at once but Secchia's ties to the military might work against the attempted coup. If it were to come to that the bolshevik hardliner could fend off the strike against his leadership through the interruption of the plenum by the army. The situation is very tense, we shall see its developments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020524_DESC;The Collectivized Agricultural System inherited from the Togliatti leadership has proved itself very failing and lead to different shortages. The situation has also been aggravated by the growing bureaucratism of the Legacoop and its control over the collective farms. We have two solutions to this issue, either we start a grand scale mechanization project to empower the local farms and increase their output, we could also try to force our hand on Legacoop and alter the buying prices to allow for greater autonomy for the collective farms that would allow for the purchase of more modern farming tools to be bought independently, or we can give up on self-sufficiency in the field and start importing grain from the USSR itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020525_DESC;Nearly 15 years have happened since the Communists tried to seize power unconstitutionally and the support for our junta seems to have decreased by the years. It may be fair to believe that the juntan outlived its purpose and that democracy could be restored, even though a longer stay into power could only do us good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020526_DESC;An avid internationalist and revolutionary General Secretary Secchia has brought forward to the party the motion for a worldwide tour in the developing world to stronger ties with the local independence and socialist movements and expand our influence abroad. This project will necessitate the expenditure of some of the state budget in international travels and aid, but we will not be the only ones who will benefit from this, we will be making a favour to the whole world furthering the cause of independence and solidarity at the expenses of our state budget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020527_DESC;General Secretary Secchia has finally reached the first stop of his International Tour, having landed in Cairo after a long trip started in Rome. The objectives of this first meeting in Cairo and that will proceed on to Damascus, Tripoli and Algiers is the consolidation of the popular movement in the Middle East and in North Africa. In Cairo Secchia has met with President Gamal abd el-Nasser, the indiscussed leader of the Arab world and has been discussing closer ties and trade with Italy. While Nasser is surely the most important player in the region, the visit to Algiers scheduled for the next week holds even more importance. Secchia has long been a supporter of the algerian struggle for independence and has found their long battle close to the battle he had fought himself during the War of National Liberation. After having met the various Heads of State and Government, Secchia is also scheduled to take part in the congresses of many local Communist parties and discuss with their leaders a common strategy of development in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020528_DESC;The next stop of Secchia's International Tour comes in a very tense situation and region. The General Secretary is once again visiting the Middle East but this time he is visiting the counties victims of Israeli aggression. A new round of talks with President Nasser has already been scheduled and now the Chairman is busy in a meeting with George Habbash and Yasser Arafat, two of the most important representatives of the Palestinian people. In these round of talks Secchia is bringing forwards all his solidarity and offering financial support to the victims of the attack, besides offering also the possibility of military cooperation with the involved countries. The crimes of Israel shall hardly be forgotten by the Arab people and the Italian government sends all the support it can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020529_DESC;Finally the last stop of Secchia's International Tour has come. The General Secretary is this time visiting the Horn of Africa to strengthen relations with the newly established revolutionary juntas in the region and express all of his hopes on the young revolutions of Africa. Currently he is residing in Addis Ababa and Italo-Ethiopian relations seem to be positive for the first time in a century, the issue of reparations has already come up but Secchia promised nothing. Instead he has been actively participating in the local intellectual scene, attending various conferences and meeting the young ethiopians leading the country our of feudalism. In the next week Secchia is expected to fly to Sudan to attend the Congress of the Sudanese Communist Party who has had a growing and decisive role in the country politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020530;The Government of Mao in China has recently launched what it has called the "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution", a society-wide effort to tackle the issues of class struggle under socialism and the abolition of remaining reactionary elements within chinese society. The revolutionary impetus has had great impact on the whole world and now our party is considering if it is the case to launch a minor campaign that takes inspiration from the chinese events. The supporters of this so called "Cultural and anti-Fascist Revolution" argue that we may learn from the chinese a new structure of rankless military, more fluid and adaptable, while also arguing that there is a need to purge the remnants of the fascist ventennium from Italian society. Indeed the former fascists within the government and its institutions are a lot and some of those keep espousing their reactionary rethoric, the issue of the church is also another big point that such a campaign could address. Attacking the Church and its anti-Communist propaganda could finally give us more control in the southern regions where priests are keeping society hostage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020531;General Secretary Secchia has unfortunately died at the age of 72 due to health reasons. Now the party has assembled to decide the fate of the country. While Pietro Ingrao, a reformist on the left very active in the cooperative movement, that has managed to rise the ranks thanks to the cultural revolution, has temporarily been acting as General Secretary, his rule is all but decided, a gang of four has formed to contrast his rise. This group of hardliners is headed by Arrigo Boldrini, a former partisan leader who has been very close to Secchia throughout all the steps of his carreer, ostensibly the most moderate of the 4. To help his rise Boldrini has allied with Secchia's old associate Giuseppe Alberganti, the revolutionary anti-revisionist calabrese trade union leader Enzo Misefari and the Italian ambassador to Beijing Osvaldo Pesce. The battle is on, we shall see who comes on top.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020532_DESC;The election of Luigi Longo to the position of General Secretary has lead to a wave of normalization with the USSR. Longo's pragmatism and his ability to mediate conflicts brought him to a round of talks with soviet leadership over the re-unification of the communist movement. Longo has flown to Moscow where he has been discussing the terms of such a normalization. Longo's goal is to gain for Italy an independent position that would permit the country to express constructive criticisms and manage an own foreign policy, but shall the soviets be picky we may not have much chance and bow to their line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020533_DESC;Tensions and ideological differences between Italian and Soviet Governments have reached a boiling point after Kurshchev's enounciation of Peaceful Coexistance. Our delegation seems to have alligned during the latest international conferences with the chinese ones and it is rumoured that Mao himself is seeking our for Secchia to build together an alternative communist front. The chinese have always been great allies and such an alliance could very much benefit us, but the isolation that could come from this could be bigger than any benefit so we should very much also take into consideration the eventuality of a neutral future for Italy, independent of Mao and Kurshchev.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020534_DESC;The agricultural policies of comrade Togliatti have long been acknowledged as a failure, and now that Longo is General Secretary that issue can finally be addressed. Coming from a farmer's family himself and being very popular with the countryside, Longo has planned through and for an extensive reform of the national's primary sector. The main body of this reform is going to be the Legacoop, thanks to the organizing body, that will itself undergo a structural change to give more power to its local branches, the collective farms are going to be subject to less state control and instead allow to run their own businesses. Legacoop will secure better prices for specific crops while taxes will be lowered. New farming tools are also being deployed and will be turned to the cooperatives. Lastly, through the Legacoops collective farms will now be able to group themselves independently on a regional basis to better compete on the local and international market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020535_DESC;Thanks to the works of the Institute for Communist Studies a never seen before testament of late leader Togliatti has been found among his manuscripts. The text was found during the composition of Togliatti's Collected Works. This discovery set new light on the thought of the father of the Republic, who appears to have taken a much harsher stance on the USSR during the last days of his life. According to the manuscripts the Hegemonic role of the CPSU over the International Communist Movement has greatly sabotaged the worker's movement and Soviet Socialism itself seems to have taken a blow by this sabotage, having recessed into bureaucratism and authoritarianism. Now great questions arise, shall we publish the full text with the risk of angering our allies, shall we publish a censored version of the text omitting the most outrageous claims or should we just keep the text tacit and pretend it never got discovered?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020536_DESC;General Secretary Longo has recently left for Prague to visit the newly elected Chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Alexander Dubcek. Longo has identified in Dubcek a possible ally for his polycentric vision of socialism and wishes to learn more about the project and policies of the reformist leader. Dubcek's "Socialism with a Human Face"  and his gradualist approach to the development of socialism seem to fit very well with the material conditions of Italy and Longo may wish to import some of his visions here, who knows if when he gets back to Rome he shall embark on a new path?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020537_DESC;Warsaw Pact troops lead by the USSR have entered Prague in what is officially called "Operation Danube". The military operation comes after weeks of tensions between the USSR and Czechoslovakia over the independent foreign and domestic policies of the latter. Soviet diplomats are asking for our army to also take part in the operation but General Secretary Longo might have differing opinions. Longo has very good relations with the Czechoslovak leader and is somewhat sympathetic to him even on an ideological level, it is not unsurpising if he will decide to defy Moscow's directions and make a public attack on the Invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020538_DESC;The Government of the Italian People's Republic headed by Luigi Longo has publically condemned our intervention in Czechoslovakia. This is a dangerous precedent that has already strained our relations with the italians and could do even more danger, but it is true that our intervention in another country at this very moment could only possibly make the situation worse, but this hasn't stopped the KGB's highest ranks from pushing forward the possibility of a palace coup headed by more friendly elements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020539_DESC;Under the guidances of Moscow and help from the KGB conservative Armando Cossutta has immobilized the government moving against General Secretary Longo. Our protests to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia have had an echo and this is the russian answer. Cossutta and other partymen have locked Longo prisoner during a special meeting, in which his leadership is now being decided upon, but there is only a little ammount of time for which the pro-Moscow plotters can keep the session open before the arrival of friendly forces to the General Secretary. Will Italy face the same treatment as Czechoslovakia, or will Longo manage to fend off this coup attempt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020540_DESC;Due to his failing health and the stress faced in the last years of government General Secretary Longo has decided to resign from his position. Longo had a stroke in 1969 and the confrontation with the USSR put the 70 years old leader and too much stress. The Party is now meeting to elect its new general secretary. The most favored successor is Enrico Berlinguer, the former chairman of the FGCI (Italian Communist Youth Federation) and close aide of both Longo and Togliatti. Berlinguer represents a new generation of communists having been born after the Livorno Congress and his policies are set to follow the road traced by the two former leaders, incentivizing the polycentrism of italian communism. On the other side we have Giorgio Napolitano, supported by the Amendola faction, he is considered a reformist and the generational leader of his faction. Napolitano was also born after Livorno but his political path is going to focus more on a European re-approachment and independence from Moscow rather than polycentrism per-se.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020541_DESC;Having reached 80 General Secretary Longo has passed away in his sleep. Now the party has called on a special meeting to elect a new secretary. The sectarian struggle within the younger generations of the PCI has reached boiling points and it seems like the most likely candidate is going to be the 70 years old Gian Carlo Pajetta. Pajetta has long been one of the most popular figures within the party and his rule is seen as a possible compromise to safeguard unity of the state. The reformist faction headed by Giorgio Napolitano has widely been calling for distance from the USSR and their ties to the Legacoop establishment has created quite some problems in Emilia-Romagna and Campania, where funds seem to have been embezzled, while the muscovite faction rallied around Armando Cossutta has been waging a real war on Napolitano's reformists. The party is in a very precarious state and we wish they may pick the best choice after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020542_DESC;The agricultural policies of comrade Togliatti have long been acknowledged as a failure, and now that Amendola is General Secretary that issue can finally be addressed. The General Secretary has long established himself close to the leadership of the Legacoop and wishes to use his position to solve the agricultural issue. Amendola's plan is to break up the old collectivization and instead organize farmers into specialized branches directly through the Legacoop. Each farmer will tie itself to the cooperatives and form independently their agricultural enterprises within the actual system, through the introduction of special bonds they will also be able to get preferential prices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020543_DESC;It is no secret that Amendola's eyes have always been pointed towards Europe and his last proposal makes it even more obvious. After his meeting with the Communist Party of Spain in exile, where he welcomed both the old president Dolores Ibarruri and the younger Chairman Santiago Carrillo, the General Secretary thought we may need a Commission for European Integration tasked to organize and manage a coherent and united worker's movement in the West. The first issues this project faces is the most likely opposition from Moscow of any similiar programme, an independent foreign policy in Europe will seem like a threat to their hegemony and our own financing of europeanist parties might seem like a direct competition to their influence. But the Communist Parties of Western Europe have long actually stood for this position and by giving them a valid platform and backing those sentiments that have had to be silenced until now could finally see their full power unleashed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020572;Held in Berlin, at the Interhotel Stadt Berlin, after months of delay, the Conference of Communist and Workers Parties of Europe, will sign a turn in the world communist movement. The Soviet CPSU had been pushing for years for the meeting to help strengthen the movement and their position in the world but they don't know what's coming. What was meant to be a reconciliation meeting will begin with the coordinated announcement of General Secretary Amendola and other sympathizers of a New Course for socialism in Europe, Eurocommunism, a new formulation of marxism studied by our and the spanish and french ideological departments that take into account the material conditions of Western Europe and of the new emerging reality. During pre-Conference talks Finland's SKP, Sweden's VPK, San Marino's PCS and Great Britain's CPGB expressed sympathy for our position and possible support in the eventuality of a showdown with the CPSU, while ruling SKJ and PCR, respectively from Socialist Yugoslavia and Romania, also expressed sentiments of animosity towards the Soviets. The work of years will finally have its fruits and we hope the Soviets will not react too harshly to this take of position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020544_DESC;The Italian delegation at the Conerence of Communist and Workers Parties of Europe in Berlin opened the meeting with a harsh attack on our party and way of life. PCI's General Secretary Giorgio Amendola spoke of a "new development in marxism" and reiterated the independence of Italy and other countries from the Soviet Union. Alongside PCF's Georges Marchais and PCE's Santiago Carrillo he also introduced a new prospective of European Socialism that will take its form under the ideological hegemony of Italy. This is untolerable and our agents are already on the move on how to contrast this, some propose a full out military operation while other sectors in the KGB are thinking of a palace coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020545_DESC;Under the guidances of Moscow and help from the KGB conservative Armando Cossutta has immobilized the government moving against General Secretary Amendola. Our actions and words at the Berlin Conference have had an echo and this is the russian answer. Cossutta and other partymen have locked Amendola prisoner during a special meeting, in which his leadership is now being decided upon, but there is only a little ammount of time for which the pro-Moscow plotters can keep the session open before the arrival of friendly forces to the General Secretary. Will Eurocommunism survive this?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020546_DESC;The Red Army has restored control over the country and the counter-revolutionary forces loyal to Amendola have been defeated. The former General Secretary was arrested and a new Central Committee has been formed. In today's meeting the new direction of the Party elected Armando Cossutta General Secretary and a new era for Italy is born to be made. Society will see a normalization now after the excesses of the Eurocommunist period and our relations with the USSR will go back to normal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020547_DESC;The inability of General Secretary Amendola to maintain his promises and go through with the separation from the USSR and enact the needed reform have lead a group of dissatisfied party members to head a coup against the leader. These young turks who want to go through with the reforms have quickly found a majority within the Plenum of the CC of the PCI and its directive leadership. Alessandro Natta was temporarily elected General Secretary while Enrico Berlinguer will from now on be Prime Minister while Achille Occhetto President of the Parliament. This triumvirate through its collective leadership will surely be able to address all the shortcomings of the previous administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020548;The collective leadership has recently fallen apart as Berlinguer with the help of Natta moved towards the removal of Occhetto as President of the Parliament in favour of Pietro Folena, a close associate of Berlinguer. Berlinguer wishes to use this situation to secure an allied government that will be able to elect him General Secretary at the next party congress, but Occhetto is not alone, his position within the party is secured by his ties to the Legacoop and this could very much help in these conditions, outmaneuvering the Prime Minister and his stooges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020549_DESC;Under General Secretary Amendola italian society has vastly liberalized allowing for more expression and creativity. Italian Cinema has become popular worldwide and many literary masterpieces have also been produced but the biggest shocks have been witnessed among the youth. Western counterculture movement have popped up in our peninsula, in Milan, Rome and even Turin, these youngsters have not become rare sights. And as the administration relaxed laws also relaxed, in the last few years various emendments have passed cementifying these democratic gains and securing a safe future for the italians of tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020550_DESC;At the ripe age of 73 General Secretary Giorgio Amendola died due to an illness in a hospital, a few hours later his wife Germaine Lecocq also died. Having lead the PCI into a more prosperous age and having been a key leader of the Resistance as the PCI's representative to the CLN in 1944 he will surely be remembered by the masses with love. Now the Party has gathered to elect a new leader and the most likely option seems to be Giorgio Napolitano, the long time personal secretary of Amendola and his political heir, but Armando Cossutta and his hardline pro-Soviet faction have been quite combattive and the muscovites seem to be ready to ally with the center to elect Gian Carlo Pajetta, one of the oldest functionaires of the PCI who has always enjoyed much popular support, to avoid the victory of Napolitano's Miglioristi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020551_DESC;The agricultural policies of comrade Togliatti have long been acknowledged as a failure, and now that Ingrao is General Secretary that issue can finally be addressed. The General Secretary believes that to tackle the agricultural problem we must link the farms to the industries. Through the use of the Legacoop cooperatives formed by both industrial and agricultural workers will be formed, with farms providing the factories with food and factories providing new tools for the farms. To these new economic entities it will be granted a degree of autonomy and self-management and they will have to report to the regional branch of Legacoop their monthly productivity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020552_DESC;Following the Hungarian example General Secretary Pietro Ingrao has drafted a revolutionary reform for the Italian economy. The Little New Economic Mechanism as they call it will greatly alter the structure of our economy, shifting to a more decentralized model. Central planning will mosty be abandoned in favour of local planning and local factories will from now on be able to freely associate themselves and form firms selling their labour at the prices they wanted within a state-mediated minimum and maximum. These new economic entity will have full decisional autonomy thanks to the establishment of worker's boards in their management and their control over the firms. These entities will also be able to sell their products abroad or import materials within their economic limits. We hope this will bring us to socialism and make the nation a shining example of a worker's state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020553_DESC;After a year from the draft of the NEM now it is finally the time it gets officially activated. Planners all over the country have been informed and special representatives have been travelling factory by factory for the last year informing workers about what they will be able to do and how to act since this very day. We await the start of operations with big enthusiasm and General Secretary Ingrao is even set to visit some of the newly established businesses in the next few hours to talk with workers and make a great propaganda image for the medias.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020554_DESC;A conservative shift in Moscow has brought the Little NEM under suspicious and many wonder if it's the case to continue the reform at all. The general consensus is to tone it down for the time being while not touching its fundamental basis, maintaining worker's control of the firms but masking it for a couple of years, even though many do not wish to give Moscow even an inch and would like to procede in defiance with their wishes like nothing happened. As the recent events in the Warsaw Pact have shown we have to be careful to not anger the russian bear and face the destruction of the long awaited reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020555_DESC;I the last few year the Italian People's Republic lead by General Secretary Pietro Ingrao has undergone what they have called the "Little New Economic Mechanism", a society-wide reform to bring worker's closer to the control of the industries and have a more efficient and streamlined economy. These reforms have greatly impacted our influence in the country and Italy has surpassed economically many other brotherly states. Some wonder if they should just let off like this even when we advised to not undergo such changes or if they are in need of a regime change from the inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020556_DESC;Under the guidances of Moscow and help from the KGB conservative Armando Cossutta has immobilized the government moving against General Secretary Ingrao. Our defiance of Moscow's order has incited a strong answer from Moscow and this is it. Cossutta and other partymen have locked Ingrao prisoner during a special meeting, in which his leadership is now being decided upon, but there is only a little ammount of time for which the pro-Moscow plotters can keep the session open before the arrival of friendly forces to the General Secretary. Will the NEM survive?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020557_DESC;Winds of change in Moscow have lead to the Little NEM to be once again favored. Now our broad program of reform can finally be enacted once again in its full extent and our moves of public propaganda in favour of it can be shown with less of a threat. Onwards to worker's power! Onwards to Socialism!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020558_DESC;Political immobilism has characterized the last few years of the Ingrao leadership and general consensus among the Central Committee of the PCI has decided that this situation cannot last. At the latest party meeting a group of concerned functionaires moved against the chairmanship of Ingrao and with a full majority Gian Carlo Pajetta, one of the oldest members of the party, has been elected to oversee a collective leadership of the country. Pajetta has always been a very popular politician among our ranks, having been a party member for more than 40 years and a close collaborator of Togliatti, and he will make a good mediator between the warring factions of the collective leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020559_DESC;To strengthen the ideological rigour of our army and of young conscripts General Secretary Ingrao has thought it could be useful to undergo a military reform introducing political commissars in the army on the Soviet and Chinese model. This move is probably going to be only the first of a series of reforms aimed at plasmating the cultural life of the country towards that of a socialist society and it may be very important in the future for the growth of the italians of tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020560_DESC;As a part of his broader cultural rectification movement General Secretary Ingrao has decided that his next target is going to be the church. Although having been a socialist state for more than 30 years our country still faces the issue of large church influence on the lower strata of the population and we may want to tackle this problem. The campaign is not going to be too harsh but priests will face harsher controls by authorities and the public role of religion is going to be discouraged through awareness programs and public events in favour of atheism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020561;Having been in power for more than a decade General Secretary Ingrao has come to believe that the country may need a new constitution. The new constitution, the second of the country's history, has already been informally dubbed the "Ingrao Constitution" and aims at cementing the conquests of the last few years of adminisration. The new piece of paper will expand the role of worker's power and worker's democracy in the constitutional framework and civil liberties are also going to see a smaller expansion while the role of the party remains monolithic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020562;The prosperity brought by the NEM has lead Italy to become an incredibly popular attraction among tourists from the East and the West alike. Due to the rapid increase in tourism based revenue Italy has been dubbed the "Eastern Bloc Beach" and we couldn't be more proud of such a nickname. We succesfully challenged the capitalist notion of socialism as a dull reality with no fun and instead brought them socialist resorts and beaches where everyone can enjoy the sun and have fun, from the poorest to the richest. Our success does not only come from the influxes from abroad but our own citizens have begun to visit the state-owned resorts always more often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020563;As the General Secretary gets older he begins to look for possible successors and aides and recently a group of Young Mavericks has made itself very prominent in party politics. These Young Miglioristi as they have been called, are a heterogenous group of reformers spearheaded by Achille Occhetto, himself 53, but the real souls of this movements are Walter Veltroni and Massimo D'Alema, both barely 40. Ingrao believes that the rise of these reformers could be encouraged to secure a linear succession and a safe future for Italy, although it will require what is obvious favoritism and corruption.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020564;The Question of the Young Miglioristi has brought upon the anger of Armando Cossutta, longtime leader of the hardliners. A personal meeting between Cossutta and Ingrao has been scheduled for today and the cold reaction of the leader to the project of these mavericks might create common ground for an axis at the next congress to rule the country in a more internationalist way. Shall the two agree on most issues Cossutta would effectively be able to become the number two in the country despite his relative age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020565;While the Young Miglioristi have managed to find themselves in a very suitable position, they still face the opposition of the hardliner faction headed by Armando Cossutta. Animosity between the two faction have always been present but this situation has been getting Cossutta very aggressive and some even wonder if it's the case to remove him and his followers from the Central Committee and the institutions to avoid any possible unfortunate event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020566;Having concentrated much power in their hands now the Young Miglioristi have moved against the General Secretary asking him to appoint one of their leader as Prime Minister and as his deputy. Although dismissing the whole government is not impossible it would be a very hard task to do so without any repercussion. Now we have to choose if to fall into the reformists' demands and continue as what is basically a puppet leader or maintain our position clear and dismiss any attempt at a coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020567;After the dismissal of the Young Miglioristi, they and their followers have gathered in front of the Botteghe Oscure (The Headquarter of the PCI) protesting their removal from power and wishing for a forceful reinstatement. While masses have gathered right in front of the symbol of power of this country Veltroni and D'Alema have been moving from within threatening the party establishment, force may be needed to disperse such an attempt of power and the tragic story of the Young Miglioristi might end with some blood and an internal purge. If we are not able to maintain a tough line their demands may increase until we are forced to capitulate. Indeed the requests of the reformers have lately been going well further to mere liberalization but they have been calling for privatization and they may start soon begin to question the very role of the party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020568;The infamous Gang of Four has as expected made her move against General Secretary Ingrao. With the help of the Army they have moved a no-confidence vote against the newly elected leader and wish to be able to swing the Central Committee through the seizing of key facilities. This is a very dangerous situation and we cannot let these fanatics turn the country apart for their own personal gains, we should move the forces loyal to us to their arrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020569;Surpisingly the arrest of the Gang of Four has sparked outrage in the masses, who seem to see in them the legacy of Chairman Secchia and a genuine popular movement. Movements in favour of their release have formed in all major cities of the peninsula and in Rome, where they are kept, the situation seems to be escalating very fast, with the threat of a possible break into the prison. We have to lay our orders for the worst case sceanario and decide if in the case of break our police force may or may not be authorized to shoot at evading suspects, even though we hope it shall not come to that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020570;Having been freed by the riotting masses the Gang of Four has been able to easily seize power regrouping with the army and striking Ingrao in his own home. Their rule is set to mark a radical shift in the politics of the country to a return of the most radical periods of the Secchia leadership. Arrigo Boldrini, Giuseppe Alberganti, Osvaldo Pesce and Enzo Misefari have decided that for the time being the country will be ruled by a collective leadership of the Central Committee of the PCI and during their speech to the nation, after having claimed victory, they have proclaimed themselves the rightful successors of Secchia and of his thought..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020571;Now that Ingrao's leadership has been secured the problem of the USSR has resurfaced. The newly elected leader is much more open to international cooperation with all socialist nations and has proved himself also more pragmatic in many fields. The government has now met to discuss a possible delegation to Moscow and the re-approchment of the Split. Shall we decide to re-open relations with the USSR we will also be able to strike better deal for prime resources that we have been lacking since the early 60's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020700;The XXIInd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has begun and General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev is set to make his last straw against stalinist sympathizers. The Congress was opened by Khrushchev's plan to reach Communism in 20 Years and continued with a motion to expell plotters Vyacheslav Molotov and Lazar Kaganovich from the party and another removing any reference of Stalin left from public institutions. This last instance would be a very radical move considering that among all it will hit Hero City Stalingrad, causing probably some discontent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020701;Since Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd, there have been many talks of restoring the historic name, but the first practical possibility has finally reached the top. General Secretary Konstantin Chernenko has been considering, after having been sollicitated by the bottom-ups, the restoration of the name Stalingrad, which would come into effect by next year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020702;The City of Stanislav celebrates its 300th Birthday. The city, laying in the western regions of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, has seen throughout its history a a wide array of names, from its original name of Stanislawòw under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, to the german Stanislau under the Habsburgs, becoming Stanislavyv under the Russian EMpire and finally Stanislav after the Great Patriotic War. To celebrate this birthday the Soviet and Ukrainian authorities have proposed to name the city after ukrainian writer and poet Ivan Franko, becoming Ivano-Frankovsk in the Russian language and Ivano-Frankivsk in the Ukrainian one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020703;In the last year a relevant number of city name change proposals have reached the Kremlin for very different reasons. We can divide these proposals in two fields, the ones from the cities themselves and those from the Politburo. Indeed the Politburo and the General Secretary himself have been pushing for cities that are named after living people to gain back their older names, this would in particular hit Molotov and Voroshilovgrad, respectively named after the two old bolsheviks, that would become Perm and Lugansk, or Luhansk in the Ukrainian language. On the other side instead the cities of Chkalov and Stepnoy have petitioned us to restore their old names, the first because the current name has never really stick out with the local population who still refers to the city as Orenburg, while the second presents instead a more touchy reality. Earlier this year the Kalmyks were allowed to return to Kalmykia and inhabit the enwly formed Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, and the returnees would like for the city to re-assume its original Kalmyk name of Elista, instead of the Russian Stepnoy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020704;Marshall of the Soviet Union Kliment Yefremovich Voroshilov has died in the hospital earlier this night. Born from a russian working class family in the Donbass region of Ukraine, he joined the Bolsheviks in 1905 and quickly built himself a political and military carreer in the aftermath of the Great October Socialist Revolution, serving in the Council of People's Commissars of Ukraine and holding the Southern Front alongside Stalin. Throughout nthe 20's he was appointed People's Commissar for Military and Navy Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the USSR. During the Great Patriotic War he served on the Finnish and Leningrad fronts. Between 1945 and 1947 he oversaw Socialist Construction in Hungary and on the eve of Stalin's death he became Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. At the age of 88 he leaves our planet having served his country until the end of his life, and now many wonder if it is the case to restore Lugansk to its former name of Voroshilovgrad in honour of the deceased Hero of the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020705;At the age of 52 comrade Andrei Aleksandrovich Zhdanov has died following a heart attack. A native of Mariupol he long had been the aide of General Secretary Stalin, vesting many important positions, such as First Secretary of the Leningrad Regional Committee of the Soviet Union, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Republic, Head of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Central Committee and most importantly Second Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This news changes the current state of affairs in the Kremlin, having lead the Cominform throughout the so called "Zhdanovshchina", he was the appointed successor of comrade Stalin. The USSR mourns his death and to honour his memory the city of Mariupol has decided to take up the name of Zhdanov.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020706;During the Great Patriotic War the term Oyrot came to be associated with Japan and japanese collabortionism, leading to soviet authorities denouncing it as counterrevolutionary. Ever since the terms "Altai" and "Altaian" have been introduced to refer to the Oyrot people and the Oyrot region. Conforming to these directives the Oyrot Autonomous Oblast has been renamed Gorno-Altai Autonomous Oblast and its regional capital, Oryot-Tura, the old Ulala, has become Gorno-Altaysk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020707;On the night of the 4th of May 1922 bolshevik activist and revolutionary Viktor Eduard Kingissepp was shot dead and thrown in the Baltic Sea by the Estonian Political Police after his arrest on the 3rd caused by his partecipation in the "illicit" May Day rally that took place on the 1st of May. Since then Kingissepp has become a martyr of the Revolution for all Estonian and Soviet communists and to honour his memory on the 30th's year of his death the city of Kuressaare, his native city, is to be awarded the name of Kingissepa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020708;Today marks the 20th anniversary of the death of Vincas Mickevicius, better known as Kapsukas, a socialist hero of the cause of Lithuanian independence and of the Great Socialist October Revolution. Having served in the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Then the Russian Communist Party "Bolshevik") and as political leader of the Lithuanian and Lithuanian-Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republics, he has become a symbol of Communism in Lithuania. To celebrate his memory the city of Marijampole has been selected to be renamed Kapsukas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020709;Originally a forestry center, the small town of Nyakh in Western Siberia has seen a very quick growth following the discovery of oil and natural gas in its soil. To serve the new industrial sectory developed in the town, thousands of workers moved to the city which has evolved in many districts. To fit the new status of the municipality, the Soviet Government has decided to birth Nyakh Nyagan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020710;The XIth Congress of the Communist Party of Romania has been opened by General Secretary Ceausescu in the buidling on Palace Square. In the opening speech Ceausescu launched what has been recognized as a new phase in the leadership of Romania. In the leadup to the congress the General Secretary had been eliminating all sources of opposition and incentrating power on himself, becoming Conducator and President of the Romanian Socialist Republic. During the congress itself, Bucharest mayor Gheorghe Cioara even proposed the title of "President for Life" for the dear leader, but he was quickly striked down. In his speech Ceausescu incentivized the struggle for socialism to become a cultural struggle too, preparing the romanian people for their socialist future and drafting a nationalist historiography set to characterize the historic greatness and collectivism of the Dacian people that for centuries fought Roman Imperialism. According to Ceausescu the Dacians are the core of Romanian nationhood and their discoveries include some of the biggest inventions of their time, the leader hopes that those interpretations and the valorization of their heritage in the modern age are a key component for mass participation in the socialist project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8005914_DESC;Eduard Shevardnadze and his Citizen's Union of Georgia have been ruling the country since the Civil War, and although having been in decline since 2000, with many groups leaving and polling always worse and worse, he nonetheless won the last elections under great suspicion by the opposition. Rampant electoral fraud has been the last straw for Georgia, who since the 90's has been facing corruption, war and poverty, so the opposition lead by former Minister of Justice Mikheil Saakashvili and Speaker of Parliament Nino Burjanadze took the streets calling for the resignation of the CUG government. Similiarly to other movements in the former eastern bloc, the georgian protests have benfitted from the help of various NGOs and citizens organizations rallying behind opposition to the government, the government of Russia has already been calling this organic movement just "another colour revolution" but this may be a real chance for Georgia to gain back her prestige and build herself a future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8008127_DESC;Having gained independence from the Soviet Union just a few years ago, the Supreme Council of Kyrgyzstan is now ready to promulgate its first ever constitution. This constitution would benefit current president Askar Akayev, who seems to be encircling always more power around himself but has also been doing wonders for our economic and international relevance. The New Constitution will officially rename Kyrgyzstan to the Kyrgyz Republic and adopt the first ever national flag of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8011708_DESC;The leader and founder of the PAIGC (African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde), Amilcar Cabral, has been located in Conakry, Guinea, by our agents in the PIDE. Cabral has lead the struggle for Bissau-Guinean and Cape Verdean Independence for now more than 10 years, humpering our Oversea Campaigns and becoming a socialist icon abroad, being greeted by Soviet and Cuban leaders throughout his visits to said countries. For years PIDE has been able to infiltrate the PAIGC but Cabral has always remained a long shot, we now know for sure that if we act fast we can take Cabral out and bring a victory home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8011709_DESC;Our great leader Amilcar Cabral has been killed in Conakry, in Guinea, earlier today by a rogue officer within his troupe. The Central Committee suspects that the rogue officer, Inocencio Kani, was on the payroll of the Portuguese and that this was a covert operation to weaken our struggle for liberation. As we mourn the death of the greatest Bissau-Guinean we shall not be demoralized and we shall strike back even harder. Cabral's step-brother, Luis Cabral, has already been approved by the CC of the PAIGC and will soon take the lead in the Independence Struggle. Long live Independent Guinea-Bissau and Independent Cabo Verde!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8011710_DESC;News have reached that a rogue officer, Inocencio Kani, probably on the Portugueses' payroll, has tried to assasinate leader Amilcar Cabral. Inocencio was thanfully stopped by the entourage of the General Secretary who having heard the rumour of a conspiracy stormed Kani's hotel room immobilizing him and putting him under temporary arrest until he will face trial in Bissau. The Portuguese fascists want to weaken our struggle but they will not be able to.Long live Independent Guinea-Bissau and Independent Cabo Verde!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8011711_DESC;The Dreams of a Union between Guinea-Bissau and Cabo Verde have long been in the eye of the governing PAIGC, today we can finally say that this dream is not a dream anymore. Having a lonh history of collaboration of solidarity the two countries fought together the struggle for national liberation and once portuguese colonial rule fell both countries moved to strengthen relations between eachother, sharing the anthem and putting unification in the Constitution. Despite PAIGC being in power already for many years in the two countries, internal issues have long made unification a hard task, but now the times are ripe, our people will finally be free and united once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8011712_DESC;Ever since Independence was achieved serious tensions have run among the ruling PAIGC. Principally between two factions the Internationalist and the Home factions, with the first being mostly composed by Cape Verdean intellectuals who share their vision with late leader Amilcar Cabral and his successor Luis Cabral, wanting to push the question of Unification between the two countries forward and wanting to take a sound international position on the side of the Socialist Bloc, while the second, headed by General-Prime Minister Joao Bernardo Vieira, is more tied to Guinea-Bissau itself, shrugging off Cape Verdeans as a foreign elite and alligning themselves with the Non-Alligned Movement. Tensions have reached a boiling point and Vieira with the army has formed a Revolutionary Council, trying to seize power for himself and oust General Secretary Luis Cabral, we shall see who will come out on top.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8011714_DESC;After the fall of the Estado Novo the Movement of the Armed Forces and the revolutionary government quickly moved to recognize the independence of Guinea-Bissau under the PAIGC, Sao Tome and Principe under the MLSTP, Angola under the MPLA, Mozambique under FRELIMO and that of East Timor, but lacking an indigenous struggle, Cape Verde was temporarily maintained under the Mainland, although with more autonomy and a new High Commissioner, Vicente Almeida d'Eca, instead of a Colonial Governor. The authorities of PAIGC in Guinea-Bissau and the broad movement in Cape Verde itself, have been pressuring for the independence of the archipelago and a summit has been arranged in Algiers to settle the issue. Considered the centuries of colonial oppression the most rightful choice would be to cede in to PAIGC and concede independence to the islands, but some nostalgics would like to boycott the summit and instead enforce the High Commissioner's authority deploying more troops to Cape Verde, this could on the other hand anger the PAIGC and trigger military escalation once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8011715_DESC;Rapidly changing international dynamics have prompted the PAICV leadership to call an extraordinary party congress to discuss proposed constitutional changes and end one-party rule. Shall the party decide to open the country to multi-party democracy and abandon Marxism-Leninism a meeting will be arranged in Praia with the opposition and an agreement to set up Parliamentary and Presidential Elections already by the next year will surely be a arranged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8011716_DESC;Rapidly changing international dynamics have prompted the MLSTP leadership to call an extraordinary party congress to discuss proposed constitutional changes and end one-party rule.

EVT_8011717_DESC;The leadership of Joao Bernardo Vieira and the PAIGC has found itself isolated after the recent changes in global dynamics. Vieira who has always been regarded as a pragmatist has convened a party congress to decide the fate of the country. It seems that to survive the PAIGC will have to abandon Marxism-Leninism and open up to multi-party democracy. Talks with the opposition had already started in 1991 and now it might be the time to fullfil our promises and bring Guinea-Bissau into a new democratic epoch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8011719_DESC;Ever since the fall of the Estado Novo and the embarking of the Processo Revolucionario Em Curso (PREC), the Provisional Government of the Third Portuguese Republic has been plagued by sectarian violence and social tensions, culminating in the Hot Summer of $YEAR$, when 10 civilians were killed. To restore order a dissident group of the Armed Forces Movement linked to the Portuguese Communist Party has tried to seize various military bases across the country to conquer political power. The central government has been alarmed and General Ramalho Eanes has been tasked with the quest to fend off the putschists and bring the country back on the path to democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8011720_DESC;Longtime Prime Minister Antonio de Oliveira Salazar has recently suffered a serious stroke and members of the ruling National Union, including president Americo Tomas, have begun to worry for the future of the nation. Tomas, vested with almost dictatorial powers, has decided to secretely fire Salazar due to his aggravating health and now has come the time to pick a successor. Two personalities have been considered for this role, Marcello Caetano and Joao Pinto da Costa Leite, Count of Lumbrales. Caetano seems to be the prefered pick of Tomas, former Rector of the University of Lisbon, he is seen as a modernizer and many hope in his leadership to gain a breath of liberty and get out of the position of inferiority that Portugal has found itself in these last years. The Count has instead been a key idealogue of the Salazar junta, having served as finance minister and main theorist of the corporatist economy, da Costa Leite is an integralist and many have speculated his ties to the former royal house of Braganza.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8011721_DESC;The 81 years old, 36 years long former Prime Minister Antonio de Oliveira Salazar has died earlier today after having recently awoken from the coma he had fallen in 23 months ago. In the last few years Salazar's health had kept deteriorating and his death does not come as a surprise to anyone but himself, the country had for the last two years went on without him and it is speculated that at the moment of his death he believed to still being the Prime Minister. This is a day of mourning for all Portuguese as the man who lead the country through its hardest times has left us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8011722_DESC;The Count of Lumbrales is aging and after more than 40 years of Estado Novo Portugal needs to find its place in the world. Through back-channels the government has in these last few yearsa pproached the House of Braganza and it would be the dream of a lifetime for the old leader to see the return of the Monarchy. Already under the long rule of Salazar the Question of the Monarchy has been an unclear topic, with the former leader flirting monarchist ideas and reserving special honours to the Braganzas despite maintaining a firm republican rule. Duarte Nuno and Duarte Pio have been summoned to Lisbon and if the negotiations go as expected the Estado Novo will flourish into a beautiful Monarchy that will safeguard the conquests of ten lustri and tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8011723_DESC;The Caetano administration has deemed the times for change in Portugal ripe. After nearly a decade of reforms Portugal is now ready to catch up with the rest of the West, but one issue has to be settled. In the last 50 years the question of a Monarchist Restoration has kept resurfacing and even Salazar himself often had flirted with such an idea, never closing that door. Restoring the Monarchy under a constitutional form would surely be the crowning of the regime's legacy and would satisfy the most conservative voices, but fully empowering the Republic would also not be a far fetched strap nor an unpopular proposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8011724_DESC;The Oversea Campaign has been succesful, dissent and marxist guerillas have been crushed in all the african territories, now it's the time to decide the future of the Pluricontinental Empire. There have been calls for the establishment of a Commonwealth of Equal Members with its central parliament in Lisbon and various localized parliaments for each territory where Lusophone culture shall florish, while more hardline voices call for the full annexation of the territories and their inglobation in the Metropolitan, crowning the Lusotropicalist dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8011725_DESC;Winds of change have swept Europe and Portugal is not exempt from any blow. Pressure both internally but especially from the outside have increased since the fall of the USSR and of the Warsaw Pact and it has come the time to address the future of the nation: the Portuguese Communist Party and the Military-Administration will hold a special congress to determine our very future. Two motions have been pushed forward at the Congress, "Democracy now" and "Building Socialism through the masses". The first motion supports the abandonment of Marxism-Leninism and the opening of the country to free and fair elections much like in many other socialist countries, while the second wishes to maintain the marxist course of the nation and build socialist and democratic power through the devolution of power to a civilian administration based on organizing committees around the whole country. But many fear a third outcome, the military has yet had to pledge their abandonment of power and there is the possibility that they will indeed not relinquish their administration, ruling as a military regime with a socialist-esque face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
