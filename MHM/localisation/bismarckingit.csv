reclaim_elsass_lothringen_title;Reclaim Elsass Lothringen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_elsass_lothringen_desc;The Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine was a territory created by the German Empire in 1871, after it annexed most of Alsace and the Moselle department of Lorraine following its victory in the Franco-Prussian War. The Alsatian part lay in the Rhine Valley on the west bank of the Rhine River and east of the Vosges Mountains. The Lorraine section was in the upper Moselle valley to the north of the Vosges. The territory encompassed 93% of Alsace and 26% of Lorraine, while the rest of these regions remained part of France. For historical reasons, specific legal dispositions are still applied in the territory in the form of a "local law". In relation to its special legal status, since its reversion to France following World War I, the territory has been referred to administratively as Alsace-Moselle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_eastern_territory_title;Reclaim Eastern Territory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_eastern_territory_desc;The former eastern territories of Germany are those provinces or regions east of the current eastern border of Germany (the Oder Neisse line) which were lost by Germany after World War I and then World War II, having been parts of the German Empire from 1871. They include provinces that historically had been considered 'German', and others that only became 'German' in 1871. Territories acquired by Poland after World War II were called there the Recovered Territories. These territories had been ruled as part of Poland by the Piast dynasty in or since the High Middle Ages, with the exception of Prussia which was inhabited by Old Prussians and came under Polish suzerainty in the Late Middle Ages, and had become predominantly German over the centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_schleswig-holstein_title;Reclaim Schleswig-Holstein;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_schleswig-holstein_desc;Contrary to the hopes of German Schleswig-Holsteiners, the area did not gain its independence, but was annexed as a province of Prussia in 1867. Also following the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, section five of the Peace of Prague stipulated that the people of Northern Schleswig would be consulted in a referendum on whether to remain under Prussian rule or return to Danish rule. This condition, however, was never fulfilled by Prussia. During the decades of Prussian rule within the German Empire, authorities attempted a Germanisation policy in the northern part of Schleswig, which remained predominantly Danish. The period also meant increased industrialisation of Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Kiel and Flensburg as important Imperial German Navy locations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_posen_title;Reclaim Posen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_posen_desc;At the end of World War I, the fate of the province was undecided. The Poles inhabitants demanded the region be included in the newly independent Second Polish Republic, while the German minority refused any territorial concessions. Another Greater Poland Uprising broke out on 27 December 1918, a day after the speech of Ignacy Jan Paderewski. The uprising received little support from the Polish government in Warsaw. After the success of the uprising, Posen province was until mid-1919 an independent state with its own government, currency and military. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, most of the province, composed of the areas with a Polish majority, was ceded to Poland and was reformed as the Pozna? Voivodeship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
look_west_title;Look West;;;;;;;;;;;;;
look_west_desc;The German Democratic Republic now stands poised as the foremost power in Central Europe. With this position, the workers revolution can finally undo the anchronistic existence of Austria and Switzerland, whom hold within them large swathes of German workers in need of unification with their motherland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8020848;The Italian Empire was the imperial project of the Italian nation from its first unification until its overseas territories were all stripped from it in the aftermath of the Second World War. With a party in power that sees fit to wage wars of expansion, the question arises whether Italy wishes to see its colonial possessions returned to it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80043282;The German colonial society was formed in 1887 to promote the expansion of German colonialism, and had grand ambitions for the role of the German Empire in Africa. Foremost in the advocacy for an empire in Central Africa, known as the Mittelafrika proposal, this organization played a heavy role in Germany's Weltpolitik. With the loss of the German colonial empire in the aftermath of the First World War, the organization shifted to one of advocacy for the return of German colonialism in some capacity or another, also taking the form of the Reichskolonialbund after the NSDAP reconstructed the organization around itself. With a sufficiently militaristic party in charge of the state, this organization can once again be reformed, in order to advocate for a new German Empire in this new era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005031;The British Dominions have long been drifting steadily away from British control, and even by now have become largely independent entities on the world stage. However, as they have drifted apart, so too have they retained friendly relations and payed homage to the traditional role London has played in their civil affairs. With the establishment of a radically altered regime in the British isles, the Commonwealth has rapidly distanced itself from the British state in protest to this act, and the last remnants of the British empire are under existential threat of destruction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005032;Despite the best efforts of both the East and the West to undo and subjugate the realms of the British Empire in the midst of their Cold War, the United Kingdom stands triumphant as a power amongst powers, an equal to the superpowers of Moscow and Washington. Britannia reserves its privileged position as the colonial power that made it the envy of the world, and its fleet remains all but unchallenged across the seas. Independence movements have proven incapable of shaking the stiff upper lip of British resolve, and it seems this era will prove to be another Pax Britannia, an era of true British sovereignty across the world's oceans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1281432;The Japanese Empire was defeated soundly in the Second World War, and all the gains it had made since the Meiji Restoration were completely undone. A disarmed nation shackled to the foot of the United States, Japan has since remained a secondary player on the world stage. All of that changes now. With a party in power that will seek the restoration of what is rightfully Japanese across the Pacific and beyond, the Rising Sun shall never set again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1281433;The whole of Manchuria has once again been taken under the wing of the benevolent Japanese Empire! With this land once again ruled by the Japanese, this opens up multiple new avenues for expansion once again, and allows for us to cement our gains in China. Should we so choose, we may also restore the Qing government to power, which may provide us with yet more claims in the region going forwards...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1281434;Indochina, once seized from the French in the midst of their crushing defeat in 1940, has been once again taken into the hands of the Japanese Empire. With Indochina secure, more expansion opportunities will undoubtedly open up in southeast asia...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1281435;The region of Inner Mongolia has been taken under Japanese control once again, and for the first time since 1945, Japan has a stake within the politics of Mongolia at large. While some in the government motion to place the land under direct Japanese occupation and settlement, others have pointed out how Inner Mongolia could best be placed under a puppet regime, the same as was done years ago under Mengjiang, laying claim to all of Mongolia in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1281436;The Philippines has once again been taken into Japanese hands, despite the best efforts of the European colonial powers to prevent the Japanese advance. With these territories once again under proper Japanese rule, the choice is once again proposed to Japan. Should Japan integrate these lands as a true colony under Japanese rule, or should a puppet regime be emplaced in order to keep the locals pliable?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1281437;Territories within China have been taken under Japanese control, and a vacuum of power has come into existence that can be exploited. Placing a puppet government in charge of Chinese lands currently under Japanese control is of paramount importance so as to ensure local compliance, at least until such time as the whole of China is under Japanese rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1281438;With a puppet government set up in China, it is of paramount importance that the puppet regime be handed any territories we take upon ourselves so as to ensure its legitimacy remains intact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1281439;With much time and effort dedicated to the preservation and expansion of the Chinese government of ours, it has now become the sole agency in control over the whole of mainland China. However, this administration will naturally not remain loyal to us in the years to come, and will undoubtedly seek its independence in the long term. There are some in the Japanese government whom see this as an ample opportunity to extract a cost from the new state for our ample support, so to speak. Others still advocate for fulfilling the dreams of our client state in Manchukuo, and granting them the territories they have longed for for centuries now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1281440;The whole of the Southern Pacific has been claimed under the majesty of the Japanese Empire, and now all that remains is to determine how this massive expanse of territory is to be managed. While many in government wish to place the whole of the land under a singular national Indonesian government, with no respect to local authorities at all, this massive federated state could prove troublesome in the future for Japanese stability. On the other hand, the lands could be held as a true colony under Japanese rule, ensuring that the resources of Indonesia properly go to the Japanese home islands. On the other hand, this massive expanse could also be broken up into a series of loyal military governorates, ensuring they remain pliable to Japanese rule and lack the capacity for further uprisings against the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_libya_title;Italian Libya;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_libya_desc;Italian Libya was once the proud crowning achievement of the Italian colonial project, and indeed the only colony to become a state in the empire, with a sizable italian settlement coming into fruition under its benevolent rule. Bringing it back under the fold is a necessity if Italy is ever to regain its standing on the world stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_tunisia_title;Italian Tunisia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_tunisia_desc;The region of Tunisia has always been within the sights of the Italian colonial empire, and was even briefly on the table for conquest in the midst of WWII. Strategically situated directly across from Sicily, control of Tunisia would allow Italy to control all regional trade crossing between the eastern and western Mediterranean, truly cementing it as the domineering power in the south of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_east_africa_title;Italian East Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_east_africa_desc;The territories of Italian Somaliland and Eritrea were the cornerstone of Italian imperialism outside of the Mediterranean, and even had for a time sizable italian communities within them. To restore these territories to vibrancy would place Italy in a key position in African politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_ethiopia_title;Italian Ethiopia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_ethiopia_desc;Abyssinia was the bane of the Italian Empire in the beginning of the scramble for Africa, and was only brought to heel by the forces of the fascist dictator Mussolini. His gains were short-lived, however, as WW2 brought an end to the new Italian possession on the continent. To restore rule here would be to bring back Italian rule in force across the whole of the horn of africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_sudan_egypt_title;Italian Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_sudan_egypt_desc;The regions of Egypt and Sudan were long in the sights of the Italian colonial empire since its inception. Situated between the colonies of Libya and Ethiopia, to conquer these lands will once and for all render the Italian Empire supreme over all of both north and east africa altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_albania_protectorate_title;The Albanian Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_albania_protectorate_desc;The whole of Albania was made into an Italian protectorate in the aftermath of the Balkan wars and the First World War. In 1939, it finally was integrated into Italy proper as a state, and subject to Italian settlement efforts. With the loss of Italy in the Second World War, these lands were stripped from it. With a properly nationalist government, these lands can be made into a rightfully Italian possession once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_greece_title;Italian Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_greece_desc;Under the rule of the dictatorship of the Italian Fascists, the whole of Greece was laid eyes upon as a potential target for Italian expansion. Bringing the whole of this territory under Italian rule, while horribly infamous, would place the Adriatic and Aegean under Italian rule, truly cementing them as Italian lakes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_levant_title;Italian Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_levant_desc;With the whole of Italy's African objectives met, only one source of living space for the Italian people remains. The Levant, rich with natural resources and lands fit for exploitation, would provide Italy with wealth unmatched in the whole of the known world, and truly cement it as a power fit to rule in the sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
german_kamerun_title;German Kamerun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
german_kamerun_desc;Founded in 1884, the German colonial project in Kamerun was one of the key few colonial institutions the Empire had in Africa, and was the origin of the perception of German colonialism as particularly brutal, due in no small part to sweeping colonial mismanagement and excessive brutality on the part of the Germans. Lost in WWI, reclaiming this colony is essential to restoring Germany as a colonial power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
deutsch_ostafrika_title;Deutsch-Ostafrika;;;;;;;;;;;;;
deutsch_ostafrika_desc;The colony of German East Africa was established in the year 1885 in order to, ostensibly, root out the slave trade in the Africa Great Lakes region. Unlike other powers, however, Germany never sought to eliminate the slave trade, merely regulating it. Similarly to German Kamerun, the colony was run in exceptionally brutal form, with organized famines and counterinsurgency warfare potentially claiming hundreds of thousands of lives in the process. Abolished in the aftermath of the First World War despite German forces never being fully ousted from the region, reclaiming this colony is a necessary next step to reigniting German ambitions in the African mainland.;;;;;;;;;;;;
deutsch_sudwestafrika_title;Deutsch-Sudwestafrika;;;;;;;;;;;;;
deutsch_sudwestafrika_desc;The colony of Deutsch-Sudwestafrika, in modern day Namibia, was established in 1894 in order to oversee German expansion in the region of South Africa. Created primarily as a coaling station and a mining colony, the region was home to the Herero genocide by the German colonial forces, and was the only colony in which Germans came to settle in large numbers. One of the first colonial holdings to fall in the First World War, to reclaim German prestige as a master in the African continent, this colony must be retaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
expand_kamerun_title;Expand Kamerun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
expand_kamerun_desc;Under the Mittelafrika proposal, Kamerun was to serve as a staging ground for further acquisitions in central and west Africa, in aims of establishing a solid base from which to move inwards.With Kamerun restored to colonial rule, and the European states thatr previously barred us exiting African affairs, further conquests have become open to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
expand_ostrafrika_title;Expand Ostrafrika;;;;;;;;;;;;;
expand_ostrafrica_desc;The region of Ostrafrika must be expanded northwards if it is to serve as a proper basis from which to claim the territories of Mittelafrika.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
unite_mittelafrika_title;Unite Mittelafrika;;;;;;;;;;;;;
unite_mittelafrika_desc;With the Eastern and Western shores of Mittelafrika secured, now is the time to finally target those acquisitions that lay in the final expanse of Central Africa. The Heart of Darkness shall be claimed for Deutschland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mittelafrika_nigeria_proposal_title;The Nigeria Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mittelafrika_nigeria_proposal_desc;In the midst of the First World War, the conflict spurred Germany to expand its Mittelafrika proposal to include French and British colonies in Central Africa, most notably in the Gold Coast and Nigeria regions. With Mittelafrika united at last, it only makes sense to expand into these locales in order to truly claim a place in the sun for Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
spanish_morocco_title;Spanish Morocco;;;;;;;;;;;;;
spanish_morocco_desc;The lands of Morocco have long been in the sights of the Spanish colonial empire, but the long and drawn out decline of the empire left no time or ability for the nation to pursue conquest of these territories. Conquering Morocco will see the Reconquista finally achieved!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
spanish_cameroon_title;Spanish Central Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
spanish_cameroon_desc;In the aftermath of the treaty of Tordesillas, the Spanish ostensibly revoked all of its claims on the African continent. However, as time went on and more pragmatic concerns came to light, Spain did attempt to establish a colonial holding in the region of Equatorial Guinea, and claimed much of Gabon and the Congo. A lack of enforcement, and the lack of Spanish involvement in the Second World War led to the claims made by both colonial Spaniards (and Franco during his negotiations with Germany) effectively null and void. Claiming them now will surely play a role in the revival of the Spanish overseas empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
portuguese_rose_map_title;The Rose-Coloured Map;;;;;;;;;;;;;
portuguese_rose_map_desc;The Rose-Coloured Map, as it was called by the British during the Scramble for Africa, was the set of Portuguese claims that would have linked the two colonies in Angola and Mozambique to one another, creating a contiguous singular colony stretching between the two coastslines of Africa. This acquisition would have rendered Portugal as a true colonial power in the modern age, but the perfidious British denied these claims to Portugal in a criminal act that undermined our centuries-long alliance. With Angola and Mozambique firmly in Portuguese hands, and the British exit from Rhodesia apparent, there is no better time than now to finally achieve Portugal's dreams in Africa...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_manchukuo_japan_title;Reclaim Manchukuo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_manchukuo_japan_desc;Manchukuo was the name given by Japan to its colonial territories in Northeastern China, ostensibly administered by the Manchu royal dynasty of the Qing. Reclaiming these territories is a necessary first step to bringing about a new Japanese age in China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
restore_qing_china_title;Claim the Mandate of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;;
restore_qing_china_desc;The Chinese Revolution of 1911 saw the complete end of the Qing dynasty in China, and the collapse of the Mandate of Heaven that had long governed the path this nation would take. Now, with Beijing back in Qing hands for the first time since the revolution, Manchuria shall once again claim the mandate of heaven and drive out the revolutionaries once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_austrian_crownlands_title;Claim the Austrian Crownlands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_austrian_crownlands_desc;Under the old Austrian Empire, the crownlands of the Austrian state were not isolated solely to the territories of German Austria, but included within them the territories of Slovenia and Bohemia, and, for a short time, the lands of Lombardy and Venice. While the nation of Austria is small, to reclaim these lands would place Austria once again as a premier state in Europe, or at the very least one worth accounting for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
firipin_no_takatai_title;Firipin No Takatai;;;;;;;;;;;;;
firipin_no_takatai_desc;The Japanese Empire once again stands at the precipice of southbound expansion into the Pacific, and into the resource-rich territories it desperately needs to maintain economic autarky and truly separate itself from the west. However, just like in the Second World War, the Philippines and the Americans that guard them stand in the way of Japanese expansion, and there is little choice but to once again press on against the American Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
marco_polo_title;Legacy of the Bridge Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
marco_polo_desc;In the year 1937, a bridge incident, claimed to have been a false flag of Japanese operatives, was used to initiate the Japanese invasion of China, one that very nearly forced the whole of the nation to bend the knee to Japanese rule. Once again, China stands isolated, vulnerable to a resurgent Japanese Empire. Placing the whole of China under our rule will solidify the status of Japan as a global power the likes of which are not to be reckoned with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
japanese_indonesia_title;Reclaim the Gunseikan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
japanese_indonesia_desc; The Gunseikan, formed in WWII as the military administration for the islands, were in turn effectively abolished in the aftermath of the Japanese surrender. Once again, Japan now stands at the precipice of controlling the whole of the Southern Pacific, and with it the achieving of true resource independence from the west. To reclaim the whole of the South Pacific will allow Japan to finally fulfill its role as the guardian of all East Asia against colonialism...and provide Japanese markets with ample room for growth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
