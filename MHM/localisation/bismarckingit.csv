reclaim_elsass_lothringen_desc;The Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine was a territory created by the German Empire in 1871, after it annexed most of Alsace and the Moselle department of Lorraine following its victory in the Franco-Prussian War. The Alsatian part lay in the Rhine Valley on the west bank of the Rhine River and east of the Vosges Mountains. The Lorraine section was in the upper Moselle valley to the north of the Vosges. The territory encompassed 93% of Alsace and 26% of Lorraine, while the rest of these regions remained part of France. For historical reasons, specific legal dispositions are still applied in the territory in the form of a "local law". In relation to its special legal status, since its reversion to France following World War I, the territory has been referred to administratively as Alsace-Moselle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_eastern_territory_title;Reclaim Eastern Territory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_eastern_territory_desc;The former eastern territories of Germany are those provinces or regions east of the current eastern border of Germany (the Oder Neisse line) which were lost by Germany after World War I and then World War II, having been parts of the German Empire from 1871. They include provinces that historically had been considered 'German', and others that only became 'German' in 1871. Territories acquired by Poland after World War II were called there the Recovered Territories. These territories had been ruled as part of Poland by the Piast dynasty in or since the High Middle Ages, with the exception of Prussia which was inhabited by Old Prussians and came under Polish suzerainty in the Late Middle Ages, and had become predominantly German over the centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_schleswig-holstein_title;Reclaim Schleswig-Holstein;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_schleswig-holstein_desc;Contrary to the hopes of German Schleswig-Holsteiners, the area did not gain its independence, but was annexed as a province of Prussia in 1867. Also following the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, section five of the Peace of Prague stipulated that the people of Northern Schleswig would be consulted in a referendum on whether to remain under Prussian rule or return to Danish rule. This condition, however, was never fulfilled by Prussia. During the decades of Prussian rule within the German Empire, authorities attempted a Germanisation policy in the northern part of Schleswig, which remained predominantly Danish. The period also meant increased industrialisation of Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Kiel and Flensburg as important Imperial German Navy locations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_posen_title;Reclaim Posen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reclaim_posen_desc;At the end of World War I, the fate of the province was undecided. The Poles inhabitants demanded the region be included in the newly independent Second Polish Republic, while the German minority refused any territorial concessions. Another Greater Poland Uprising broke out on 27 December 1918, a day after the speech of Ignacy Jan Paderewski. The uprising received little support from the Polish government in Warsaw. After the success of the uprising, Posen province was until mid-1919 an independent state with its own government, currency and military. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, most of the province, composed of the areas with a Polish majority, was ceded to Poland and was reformed as the Pozna? Voivodeship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
look_west_title;Look West;;;;;;;;;;;;;
look_west_desc;The German Democratic Republic now stands poised as the foremost power in Central Europe. With this position, the workers revolution can finally undo the anchronistic existence of Austria and Switzerland, whom hold within them large swathes of German workers in need of unification with their motherland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8020848;The Italian Empire was the imperial project of the Italian nation from its first unification until its overseas territories were all stripped from it in the aftermath of the Second World War. With a party in power that sees fit to wage wars of expansion, the question arises whether Italy wishes to see its colonial possessions returned to it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_libya_title;Italian Libya;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_libya_desc;Italian Libya was once the proud crowning achievement of the Italian colonial project, and indeed the only colony to become a state in the empire, with a sizable italian settlement coming into fruition under its benevolent rule. Bringing it back under the fold is a necessity if Italy is ever to regain its standing on the world stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_tunisia_title;Italian Tunisia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_tunisia_desc;The region of Tunisia has always been within the sights of the Italian colonial empire, and was even briefly on the table for conquest in the midst of WWII. Strategically situated directly across from Sicily, control of Tunisia would allow Italy to control all regional trade crossing between the eastern and western Mediterranean, truly cementing it as the domineering power in the south of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_east_africa_title;Italian East Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_east_africa_desc;The territories of Italian Somaliland and Eritrea were the cornerstone of Italian imperialism outside of the Mediterranean, and even had for a time sizable italian communities within them. To restore these territories to vibrancy would place Italy in a key position in African politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_ethiopia_title;Italian Ethiopia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_ethiopia_desc;Abyssinia was the bane of the Italian Empire in the beginning of the scramble for Africa, and was only brought to heel by the forces of the fascist dictator Mussolini. His gains were short-lived, however, as WW2 brought an end to the new Italian possession on the continent. To restore rule here would be to bring back Italian rule in force across the whole of the horn of africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_sudan_egypt_title;Italian Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_sudan_egypt_desc;The regions of Egypt and Sudan were long in the sights of the Italian colonial empire since its inception. Situated between the colonies of Libya and Ethiopia, to conquer these lands will once and for all render the Italian Empire supreme over all of both north and east africa altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_albania_protectorate_title;The Albanian Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_albania_protectorate_desc;The whole of Albania was made into an Italian protectorate in the aftermath of the Balkan wars and the First World War. In 1939, it finally was integrated into Italy proper as a state, and subject to Italian settlement efforts. With the loss of Italy in the Second World War, these lands were stripped from it. With a properly nationalist government, these lands can be made into a rightfully Italian possession once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_greece_title;Italian Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_greece_desc;Under the rule of the dictatorship of the Italian Fascists, the whole of Greece was laid eyes upon as a potential target for Italian expansion. Bringing the whole of this territory under Italian rule, while horribly infamous, would place the Adriatic and Aegean under Italian rule, truly cementing them as Italian lakes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_levant_title;Italian Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italian_levant_desc;With the whole of Italy's African objectives met, only one source of living space for the Italian people remains. The Levant, rich with natural resources and lands fit for exploitation, would provide Italy with wealth unmatched in the whole of the known world, and truly cement it as a power fit to rule in the sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
