coexistence_pledge_title;Renounce the Marxist Goal of World Revolution;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
coexistence_pledge_desc;World revolution is the Marxist concept of overthrowing capitalism in all countries through the revolutionary action of the working class. In most schools, the international character of the class struggle is a critical element and an explanation of the failure of socialism in one country.\n\n§YRenouncing World Revolution is thus a vital pre-requisite to starting detente§W;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

cultural_outreach_title;Initiate a Cultural Outreach between the West and East;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cultural_outreach_desc;Exchange Programs from the United States played a vital role during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. George Kennan, a key figure in the Cold War known as the father of containment, viewed culture as a way to decrease negative sentiments between countries. Examples of cultural exchange programs between the United States and the Soviet Union include theater, museum, and opera expositions. Although not political on the surface, cultural exchanges like these helped alleviate tensions and "humanise" the West in the eyes of the Soviets who witnessed them.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

space_meeting_title;Initate Cross-Bloc Cooperation in Space Programs;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
space_meeting_desc;In October 1970, the Soviet Academy of Sciences responded to NASA's letter proposing a cooperative space mission, and there was subsequently a meeting to discuss technical details. The American administration enthusiastically espoused plans for the mission, and expressed these views to NASA: "[D]o anything you want to do...in fact, I want you to tell your counterparts in Moscow that the President has sent you on this mission." By April 1972, both the United States and the USSR signed an Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes, committing to the launch of the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project in 1975.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

open_market_desc;Both bloc leaders possess massive reserves of untapped resources and a huge industrial base. This offers a lot of economic potential for us to begin trade, which may make war less likely through interdependence.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

research_partnership_desc;This Cold War and its competitive research efforts have created a more powerful research scientific complex than has ever existed before. Although we keep most of our developments a secret, almost everyone knows that the international nature of science and espionage in prominent labs mean that developments are quickly leaked, on both sides. We may accept this reality and formally cooperate with the rival bloc on non-military technological development, and show the superiority of our ideology while advancing humanity overall.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

joint_nuclear_controls_title;Propose joint superpower nuclear testing oversight;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
joint_nuclear_controls_desc;In October 1977, the US, UK, and Soviet Union returned to negotiations over a test ban. The three nuclear powers made notable progress in the late 1970s, agreeing to terms on a ban on all testing, including a temporary prohibition on PNEs, but continued disagreements over the compliance mechanisms led to an end to negotiations ahead of Ronald Reagan's inauguration as President in 1981. In 1985, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev announced a unilateral testing moratorium, and in December 1986, Reagan reaffirmed US commitment to pursue the long-term goal of a comprehensive test ban. In November 1987, negotiations on a test ban restarted, followed by a joint US-Soviet program to research underground-test detection in December 1987.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

open_borders_desc;Since the Russian Revolution, travel has been forbidden between the communist and capitalist world. However, with the concept of the Marxist world revolution gone from mainstream communist thinking, and hostility to capitalism at an all-time low, perhaps it is time to tear down the wall between the blocs.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

start_joint_aid_title;Initiate superpower cooperation in international aid programs;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
start_joint_aid_desc;In August 1987, the Soviet Union formally requested observer status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT). The Soviet Union also expressed its desire to join other international economic organisations and establish contacts with other regional groups. A major step in this direction occurred in 1988 when the Soviet Union signed a normalisation agreement with the EEC. The Soviet government, however, professed no interest in joining the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although Soviet officials claimed that the international monetary system "was not managed properly," it is more likely that IMF and World Bank regulations were the obstacles: both institutions required that members' currencies be freely convertible and that members provide accurate information concerning gold sales and economic performance.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT_8023420_NAME;End of the World Revolution;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_8023420_DESC;One of the main sticking points in the Cominform was what kind of relations to have with capitalist countries. Though we know the communist system is the one of the future, and these states are tools to control the masses and doomed to fail, they may have things we need. Such as guns. Or food. Anyway, it seems $FROMCOUNTRY$ has resolved this question for all - the capitalist order will fall of its own accord, and the immediate goal is to coexist. While this is technically revisionism, perhaps it is true that Marx could not have foreseen the atom bomb. Still, though this is not the first such instance, questioning the foundation of our ideology may be unwise.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_8023420_A;If this brings peace, so be it.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_8023420_B;Perhaps we should go our own direction from now on.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_8023425_NAME;Open Borders with the Capitalists;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_8023425_DESC;$FROMCOUNTRY$ and their "enemy" have reached an apalling agreement - to open borders to emigration and immigration with each other and all capitalist nations. Although we had, of course, heard about our bloc's loosening of tensions and abandonment of the world revolution, there was no way of knowing it would come to this. Not only are they pressuring us to do the same, but they are flying in the face of everything socialism means! How are we expected to establish a stateless society without impermeable borders?!;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_8023425_A;We hope they know what they're doing.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
