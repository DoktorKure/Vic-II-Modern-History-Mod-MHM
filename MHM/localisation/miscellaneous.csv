EVTDESC13000261;The Imperial Federation refers to a series of proposals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to create a federal union to replace the existing British Empire, presenting it as an alternative to colonial imperialism. With the devastation wrought by World War II and the subsequent rise of nationalism in the colonial nations, perhaps it is time to revisit the idea of recognizing each colony as a nation within the Imperial Federation, granting each colony its own parliament and a degree of self-government so the locals can participate in the Imperial Parliament and quell their nationalist tendencies before they decide it is better to just quit the Empire altogether.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1400068;The assembly of the International Space Station, a major endeavour in space architecture, began in November 1998. Russian modules launched and docked robotically, with the exception of Rassvet. All other modules were delivered by the Space Shuttle, which required installation by ISS and shuttle crewmembers using the Canadarm2 (SSRMS) and EVAs, as of 5 June 2011, they had added 159 components during more than 1,000 hours of EVA. 127 of these spacewalks originated from the station, and the remaining 32 were launched from the airlocks of docked Space Shuttles. The beta angle of the station had to be considered at all times during construction, as the station's beta angle is directly related to the percentage of its orbit that the station (as well as any docked or docking spacecraft) is exposed to the sun; the Space Shuttle would not perform optimally above a limit called the "beta cutoff". Many of the modules that launched on the Space Shuttle were integrated and tested on the ground at the Space Station Processing Facility to find and correct issues prior to launch.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1412061;Biological warfare is the use of biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi with the intent to kill or incapacitate humans, animals or plants as an act of war. Biological weapons are living organisms or replicating entities (viruses, which are not universally considered "alive") that reproduce or replicate within their host victims. Entomological (insect) warfare is also considered a type of biological weapon. This type of warfare is distinct from nuclear warfare and chemical warfare, which together with biological warfare make up NBC, the military acronym for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare using weapons of mass destruction. None of these are conventional weapons, which are deployed primarily for their explosive, kinetic, or incendiary potential.;;;;;;;;;;x

This time, the Arab attack was suspected but the level of confidence was low. Israel assured America, under political pressure, that it would not go for a preemptive strike. This was crucial, as other developed nations, being more dependent on OPEC oil, had stopped supplying Israel with munitions under threat of an OPEC boycott.

create_rocket_desc;In spaceflight, a launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket used to carry a payload from Earth's surface into outer space. A launch system includes the launch vehicle, the launch pad, and other infrastructure. Although a carrier rocket's payload is often an artificial satellite placed into orbit, some spaceflights, such as sounding rockets, are sub-orbital, while others enable spacecraft to escape Earth orbit entirely. Earth orbital launch vehicles typically have at least two stages, and sometimes as many as four or more.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

create_satellite_desc;In the context of spaceflight, a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit. Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth's Moon. Approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-Earth orbit, 50 are in medium-Earth orbit (at 20,000 km), and the rest are in geostationary orbit (at 36,000 km). A few large satellites have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit. Over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, a few asteroids, and the Sun. Satellites are used for many purposes. Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites, communications satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and space telescopes. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites. Satellite orbits vary greatly, depending on the purpose of the satellite, and are classified in a number of ways. Well-known (overlapping) classes include low Earth orbit, polar orbit, and geostationary orbit. Satellites are propelled by rockets to their orbits. Usually the launch vehicle itself is a rocket lifting off from a launch pad on land. Some satellites are launched at sea (from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform) or aboard a plane (see air launch to orbit). Satellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems. Satellite subsystems attend many tasks, such as power generation, thermal control, telemetry, attitude control and orbit control.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

create_space_probe_desc;A robotic spacecraft is an uncrewed spacecraft, usually under telerobotic control. A robotic spacecraft designed to make scientific research measurements is often called a space probe. Many space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower cost and lower risk factors. In addition, some planetary destinations such as Venus or the vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival, given current technology. Outer planets such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

create_space_station_desc;A space station, also known as an orbital station or an orbital space station, is a spacecraft capable of supporting crewmembers, which is designed to remain in space (most commonly as an artificial satellite in low Earth orbit) for an extended period of time and for other spacecraft to dock. A space station is distinguished from other spacecraft used for human spaceflight by lack of major propulsion or landing systems. Instead, other vehicles transport people and cargo to and from the station.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

develop_vaccine_desc;A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognise the agent as a threat, destroy it, and keep a record of it so that the immune system can more easily recognise and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters. Creating a vaccine will prevent further spread of the virus in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ cities and remove any biological weapons still present in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;x

Biological weapons are living organisms or replicating entities (viruses, which are not universally considered "alive") that reproduce or replicate within their host victims. Entomological (insect) warfare is also considered a type of biological weapon. This type of warfare is distinct from nuclear warfare and chemical warfare, which together with biological warfare make up NBC, the military acronym for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare using weapons of mass destruction. None of these are conventional weapons, which are deployed primarily for their explosive, kinetic, or incendiary potential.;;;;;;;;;;x

reclaim_eastern_territory_desc;The former eastern territories of Germany are those provinces or regions east of the current eastern border of Germany (the Oder–Neisse line) which were lost by Germany after World War I and then World War II, having been parts of the German Empire from 1871. They include provinces that historically had been considered 'German', and others that only became 'German' in 1871. Territories acquired by Poland after World War II were called there the Recovered Territories. These territories had been ruled as part of Poland by the Piast dynasty in or since the High Middle Ages, with the exception of Prussia which was inhabited by Old Prussians and came under Polish suzerainty in the Late Middle Ages, and had become predominantly German over the centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

reclaim_elsass_lothringen_desc;The Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine was a territory created by the German Empire in 1871, after it annexed most of Alsace and the Moselle department of Lorraine following its victory in the Franco-Prussian War. The Alsatian part lay in the Rhine Valley on the west bank of the Rhine River and east of the Vosges Mountains. The Lorraine section was in the upper Moselle valley to the north of the Vosges. The territory encompassed 93% of Alsace and 26% of Lorraine, while the rest of these regions remained part of France. For historical reasons, specific legal dispositions are still applied in the territory in the form of a "local law". In relation to its special legal status, since its reversion to France following World War I, the territory has been referred to administratively as Alsace-Moselle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

reclaim_posen_desc;At the end of World War I, the fate of the province was undecided.

Another Greater Poland Uprising broke out on 27 December 1918, a day after the speech of Ignacy Jan Paderewski. The uprising received little support from the Polish government in Warsaw. After the success of the uprising, Posen province was until mid-1919 an independent state with its own government, currency and military. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, most of the province, composed of the areas with a Polish majority, was ceded to Poland and was reformed as the Pozna? Voivodeship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

reclaim_schleswig-holstein_desc;Contrary to the hopes of German Schleswig-Holsteiners, the area did not gain its independence, but was annexed as a province of Prussia in 1867. Also following the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, section five of the Peace of Prague stipulated that the people of Northern Schleswig would be consulted in a referendum on whether to remain under Prussian rule or return to Danish rule. This condition, however, was never fulfilled by Prussia. During the decades of Prussian rule within the German Empire, authorities attempted a Germanisation policy in the northern part of Schleswig, which remained predominantly Danish. The period also meant increased industrialisation of Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Kiel and Flensburg as important Imperial German Navy locations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Biological weapons are living organisms or replicating entities (viruses, which are not universally considered "alive") that reproduce or replicate within their host victims. Entomological (insect) warfare is also considered a type of biological weapon. This type of warfare is distinct from nuclear warfare and chemical warfare, which together with biological warfare make up NBC, the military acronym for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare using weapons of mass destruction. None of these are conventional weapons, which are deployed primarily for their explosive, kinetic, or incendiary potential.;;;;;;;;;;x

space_meeting_desc;In October 1970, the Soviet Academy of Sciences responded to NASA's letter proposing a cooperative space mission, and there was subsequently a meeting to discuss technical details. The American administration enthusiastically espoused plans for the mission, and expressed these views to NASA: "[D]o anything you want to do...in fact, I want you to tell your counterparts in Moscow that the President has sent you on this mission." By April 1972, both the United States and the USSR signed an Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes, committing to the launch of the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project in 1975.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

space_private_desc;In the early decades of the Space Age, the government space agencies of the Soviet Union and United States pioneered space technology in collaboration with affiliated design bureaus in the USSR and private companies in the US, entirely funding both the development of new spaceflight technologies and the operational costs of spaceflight. The European Space Agency was formed in 1975, largely following the same model of space technology development. Later on, large defense contractors began to develop and operate space launch systems, derived from government rockets. Private spaceflight in Earth orbit includes communications satellites, satellite television, satellite radio, astronaut transport and sub-orbital and orbital space tourism.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

start_joint_aid_desc;In August 1987, the Soviet Union formally requested observer status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT). The Soviet Union also expressed its desire to join other international economic organisations and establish contacts with other regional groups. A major step in this direction occurred in 1988 when the Soviet Union signed a normalisation agreement with the EEC. The Soviet government, however, professed no interest in joining the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although Soviet officials claimed that the international monetary system "was not managed properly," it is more likely that IMF and World Bank regulations were the obstacles: both institutions required that members' currencies be freely convertible and that members provide accurate information concerning gold sales and economic performance.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
