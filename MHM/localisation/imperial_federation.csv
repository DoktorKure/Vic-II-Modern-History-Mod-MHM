EVTDESC13000261;The Imperial Federation refers to a series of proposals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to create a federal union to replace the existing British Empire, presenting it as an alternative to colonial imperialism. With the devastation wrought by World War II and the subsequent rise of nationalism in the colonial nations, perhaps it is time to revisit the idea of recognizing each colony as a nation within the Imperial Federation, granting each colony its own parliament and a degree of self-government so the locals can participate in the Imperial Parliament and quell their nationalist tendencies before they decide it is better to just quit the Empire altogether.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
